  "text": "A  simpl e  anchor  is  a  one-point  anchor -a  single  nut,  spr ing-loaded  camming  device  (SLCD),  sling,  fixed  piton,  etc.-as  opposed  to  combining  single -point  anch ors  into  the  solid  matrix  of  a  belay  anchor .  Because  the  foundation  of  all  anchor  matrixes  rests  with  the  simple  primary  placements,  the  im por tance  of  obt aining  bombpr oof  simpl e  anchor s  cannot  be  oversta ted.  Appr op riate  gear ,  suitable  cracks and  adequa te  rock  quali ty  are necessary  to  obtain  a  solid  anchor .  Without  all  three,  we're  hosed.  You  might  th ink  the  absence  of  good  cracks  would  be the  most  dir e,  yet  I  reca ll  a  story from  my  friend  and  pa rt­ ner  Richard  Ha rrison  that  ill ustrates  what  can  happen  when  the  gear  is  lacking.  Richard  and  the  late, great  Ni ck  Escr ow  were high  on  El  Capitan  when,  moored  at  a  hanging  bel ay,  Nick  handed  Richard  a  1- inch  nylon  runner  conta ining  most  all  of  th eir  ra ck.  To  their  ho rror,  the  knot  on  the  sling  came  untied,  and  the  entire  rack  dropped  into  the  void.  That  left  them  with  about  eight  nuts  and  assor ted  pegs  filched  from  the  bottom  of  the  haul  bag,  and  the very  anchor  from  which  they  dan­ gled. They  also  were  able  to  clean  a  couple  nea rby  fixed  pin s,  but the  last pitches  were  ex tremely  touch-and-go  as  they  leap frogged  along, sometimes able  to  climb  but  50  feet  before  having to  stop  and  belay  in  a  weird  and  peri lous  spot,  some- 17  \ntimes  \"anchored\"  and hauling  from a  si ngle  wired  nut.  Dreadful.  By  contrast,  on  Himala yan  alpine  routes,  a  team  can  have  exactly  the  right  gear  and  ample  cracks,  but  owing  to  poor  quali ty  rock,  secu rity  is  but  a  dr eam.  To  the  layman  glancing  thr ough  the  following  cha pters  on  the  various  pr otec­ tion  devices,  the  whole  lot  may  seem  bewildering  and  complex.  Yet the  basic  use  of  protec tion  usuall y  is  stra ight forwa rd  and  self - evident.  Simpl y  put,  you  sele ct  a  section  of  crack,  and  place  in that crack a  pr otecti on  device  of  corres ponding  size.  The  pr ocess  is  not  terribly  unlik e  working  those  wooden  puzzles  when  we  were  kids  and  we  stuck  the  big  star  into  the  big  star-s haped  hole.  Sin ce  the  size  of  the  crack  dic tates  what  gear  can  be  used,  you  instantly can  elimina te  all  gear  out side  a  specific  size  range.  If  you'r e  look ing  at  a  ha lf -inch  crack,  you  have  only  to  consider  options that  can  possibly  fit that crack.  Much  mor e  on  this  later .  In  the  absence  of  a crack, the rock  mig ht  offe r a  suitable  pr otr udin g  or  tunnel- \"Good- enough\"  anch ors  require:  1.  Suitable  cracks  2.  Adequate  rock  quality  3.

Strength  and  security  throughout  the  system  18  CL IMBING  ANCHOR S  ing  feature, or a  luxuriant  tree  or  bush.  In  these  cases,  an  anchor  may  be  secured  by  sli nging  the  natural  feature.  Of  cour se,  an  ever -increasing  num ber  of  face  routes  have  been  equipped  with  bolts,  and  obtaining  anc hors  on  these  fixed  routes  req uir es  only  clipping  into  the  bolt  hang er,  negating the  need  to  place any  gear  at  all.  But  when  the  anchor  involves  hand-placing  gear  in  a  crack  or  rigging  sling s  about  natural  features,  the  main  goal  is  to  obtain  the  strongest  anchor  possible  from  the  given  crack  or  feature.  \nNatural  anchor s  consist  of  anyth ing  that  the  envi­ ronment  provid es- trees,  blocks,  horns  of  rock,  etc.  Many times  a  natural  anchor  is  stronger  than  anything  you  could  arrange with  store- bought  gear .  Like  any  other  anch or,  there  are  num erous  consid erati ons  that  affect  the  strength  of  a  natu­ ral  anc hor .  Of  the many  advantages  of  using sound  natu­ ral  anc hor s,  three  st and  out.  Fir st,  they  are typi­ cally  easy  and  fast  to  arrange.  Yo u  might  simply  loop  or  gi rth  a tree  or  a  block  (or  whatever)  with  ru nner s.

Third, natural  anchor s  are  usually  the  least  environmentally  disrup- tive  means  of  protec tion.  TREES  Anchoring  to  a  50-fo ot  oak  that  casts  a  shadow  lik e a  thundercloud  is  pretty  str aig htforward  work.  Ju dgment  enter s  the  game  once  the trees  become  smaller  and  ar e  located  on  top  of  the  cl iff,  on  ledges  and on she lves.  I've  seen  some  ana ly­ ses  of  which  trees  are  best  suited  for  use  as  anch ors;  some  of  these  go  so  fa r  as  to  study  the  indi vidual  gr ain  of  the  tree.  But  most  of  this-and  everyth ing else  for that  matter -basically  boils  down  to  common  sense.  Still  there  are several  consid era­ tions  worth  noting.  Some  clim ber s  thi nk  anyth ing  with  bark  on it  is  bomber ,  and  the  infamous  To bin  Sorrenson  was  one  of  them.  It  was  at  Granite  Mou nt ain -not  the  gem  in  Presco tt,  19  \nShar on  Sadlier  belays  Heidi Benton  on  Pete  &  Bob's, Garden of the  Gods,  Colorado.  PHOTO  BY  STEWART M. GREEN.  Arizona,  but a scrappy  li ttle  cl iff  outside  Amb oy,  Calif ornia,  that has  fo r  years  been  closed  to  climbing. (An old  rummy  with  a  12 -gauge  fu ll  of  rock salt  sta nds  guard,  in  case  you'r e  wondering.)  To bin  was leading  up  one  of  those  greasy,  teete ring  slabs  that  look  lik e  you  could  make  good  time  up  it  in flip  flops, when  in  fact  your  only hope  is  to  keep  your  $15 0  boo ts  bicycling  lik e  Wile  E.  Coyote.  When  I  clawed  up  to  To bin' s  belay  and  saw  the  anchor , I  lost  my  mind.  \"What  the hell  is  that,  To bin?!\"  20  CL IMBING  ANCHOR S  \n\"It 's  a  tree  ....  \"  I'd  shot  pool  with a  bigger  \"tree\"  than this  one .  \"Th at's  not a tree,  it's  a  twig.  A dead  twig.\"  And  it  was  sti cking  out  of  a  clump  of  orange  moss  on an  angled,  shaly  li ttle  footh old  stance.  I  reached  over  and  yanked  the sad  thing  out  with  about  ten  pounds  of heft.  \"Jesus!  Yo u  trying to  kill  us  or  something?!\"  To bin  cried.  The  point  is  that  what  the  tree  is  rooted  in  is  probably  more  crucial than the  breadth  of the tree  itself.  Good-sized  trees  have  pulle d  out;  the  big  one  atop the  fi rst  pitch of  a  route called  Catchy,  at  the  Cookie  Cl iff  in  Yo semite,  being  a  case  in  point. While  ther e  is  lik ely  no  single  and  rel iable  way  for  a  clim ber  to  know  or  test  how  well  a  tree is  rooted,  we'r e left  to do  a  thorough  inspection,  including  shaking  the tree  to  check  for  movement. While  some  books  have  su ggested  various  forestry  str ategies  to  establish  the  holding  power  of  trees,  no  two trees  are  the  same.  I' ve  per sonally  hooked  a  tractor  to  a  tree  no  thicker  than  my  arm  and only  managed  to  break  a  chain  in  trying  to  yard  out  the  implacable  pine.  I've  also seen  trees  big  ar ound  as  a  pick le  barrel  come  totally  upr ooted  after  a  thunder  sh ower.  Neverth eless  we  need  a  few  prov isional  guideline s  to  help  guide  our  choices.  First,  you  want  a  live  tree,  prefer ably  6  inches  or  mor e  in diam eter,  not  one  that's  been  choppe d  or  burned  or  is  rotte n.  Any  tree  rooted  in  shallo w  soil,  gravel,  scree, moss or soot,  or  that's  burgeoning  from  a  slim  crack,  should  be  consider ed  suspec t.  If  you've  no  other  choice  for  an  anchor -or  even  if  you  have-test  the  tree  with  a  solid  shak e.  Boot it,  try  to  rip  it  out.  If  it sti ll  feels  sound,  it  probably  is.  Remem ber , of  course,  that  a  serious  leader  fall  can  gener ate  much  mor e  im pact  force  than  a  yank on the tree.  Whenever  poss ible,  tie  the  tree  off  with  sli ngs  or  a  cordele tte  ins tead  of  looping  the  rope  around  the  trunk.  Once  you get  sap  on  a  rope,  it's  lik e a  bum  rap  or mem­ orie s  of  lo ve- you  just  can't  shak e  it.  Plus,  the  pivoting  action  common  when  lean­ ing  off  the  anchor  can  quic kly  abrade  the  sheath  of  a  rope.  Go  with  ru nner s  or  a  nylon  cordele tte.  Unle ss  the  tree  is  truly  a  whopper ,  tie  it  off  as  low  as  possible  to  reduce  lever ­ age.  Never  tie  off  a  tree  with  a  loop  of  biner s.  Girth-hitched  runner s or a  cordele tte  are  both  popul ar  methods  {see  photos  and  ill ustrat ions).  A  cordele tte  is longer  than most  sling s,  negating  the  need  to  girth-hitch  two  slin gs  togeth er  to  reach  arou nd  the  tree.  Although arr anging  a  gir th-hitch  to  conn ect  two  slin gs  is  simple  as  ra in,  a  recent  ra pp el  ling  accident  in  Arizona cost  a  won derful  young  woman  When  anchoring  to  a  tree  .. .  •  Make  sure  t  a!l, , e  •  Use  slings  or  a  ordelette  111stead of  rope  to  tie it  off  •  Tie  It  off  as  low  as  po!>Sib!e  to  reduce  leverage.

At  Great  Falls  and  Carder  Rock,  both  in  the  Wa shi ngt on,  D.C.,  area,  and  at  Cooper s  Rock,  outside  of  Mor gantown,  West  Virginia,  trees  are  used  alm ost  exclusively  as  toprope  anchor s.  Owing  to  soil  compac tion  and  wear and tear  on  the tree  trunks,  authorities  have  consid ered  closing  down  secti ons  of  the cl iff side.  Clim ber s  have  res ponded  by  adopting  gen­ tler  methods  of  anchoring  off  trees,  such  as  using  scraps  of  carpet  to  pr otect  the  bark.  22  CL IMBING  ANCHORS  \nAnchoring  to  a  Tree  Incorrect .

Henc e,  they  often  make  good  an chors.  As a  general  rule,  it  is easier  and  less  time-consuming  to  rig a  tr aditional  anchor ,  pr ovid­ ing one  is  rea dily  available.  But  if  good  nu ts  are  problematic  to  set,  and  a  shrub,  bush  or sapling  is  at  hand,  consider  using it.  Aga in,  you  want live  stuff.  Nothing  brittle,  charred,  rotten  or  loose  will  do.  And  mak e  sur e  the  stuff  is  well-rooted.  Most  of  the  ti me  a  shr ub or  bush  issue s  from  a  central  root, and  that's  what  you  want  to  slin g.  Try  to  get  the  sling  around  that  chubby  root  as  nea r  to  the  base  as  possible,  and  cinch  it  down  snug.  It  is  very  sk etchy to  trust a  sol itary  bush  or  shrub,  and  since  they  tend  to  grow  in  clumps,  tying  off  to  three  or  four (or mor e)  and  equalizing  these  anchor s  (to  be  explained  later)  is  smart  rigging.  Mor e  times than not  you'll  have  to  ferret  around  and  push  sometim es-th orny  li mbs aside  to get at  the  main  root.  Do  so.  Never  settle  for less  than  the  best  and  leas t-leveraged  tie-of f  you  can  manage.  And  al ways  test  the  bush  or  shrub  with  a  hea rty  yank.  Unless  you  test  it  and  test  it  good,  you  might  be  tyi ng  off  someth ing  no  more  secur e  than  a  tumble weed  on  a  bridal  path.  BOULDERS  AND  BLOCKS  These  can  provide  sound,  quick  anch ors  if  several  things  check  out,  and  you  follow  a  few rules  of  thumb.  Fir st,  realize  that  both  bould ers  and  bl ocks  are  not  part  of  the  body of  the  cl iff.  They  are  det ached, and  the only  thing  keeping  them  in  place is  their  size,  weight  and position.  For  a  boulder  or  blo ck  to  be  any  good  at  all,  it  must  be  both  suf fi ciently  big and  positioned  in  a  way  that  it  cannot be  moved.  It  should  not  wiggle  or  budge  at  all.  Anyo ne  who has  tr und led boulde rs  off  a  remote  slab  knows  that  a  boulder  big  as  a  house  can  be  sent  on  a  path  of  mind -boggl ing  destruction  if  it's  on  even  the  sligh test  grade.

For  a  leader  rigging  a  belay  anchor ,  caution  must  be  used  when  tying  the  climbing  rope  itself  around  huge  blocks.  Watch  out  for  sharp edges  and  pinches  that  can  severely  damage  your  cord.

Static rope  is  also  somewhat  handier  to  work  with  and  easier  to  knot, and  it  allo ws  you  to  use  a  wider  range  of knots  than  would  work  with  we bbing  or  sling  materia l.  Sometimes  the  best  way  to  use  a  block  is  to  encircle  the mass  of  it,  tying  it  off  like  the ribbon  on  a  bi rthday  gift,  instead  of  run­ ning  the  sling under neath  it.  HORNS  We  use  \"horn\"  her e  to  denote  all  kinds  of  protr usions  that  one  might  possibly  slin g  for  pr otecti on.

Hence,  it is  the  position  of  the  flak e  that  is  our fi rst  concern.  If  the  flake is  pasted on a  bald  wall  like  a  flapjack  on a  garage  door , it's  notably  suspe ct.

On  well- trav eled  routes,  most of  the  loose  rock  has  alr eady  been  stripped  away  by  previous  parties,  but  don't  bank  on  it .

I  was  bela y­ ing  from  sli ngs,  and  as  Ron  came  up,  I  noted  a  thick,  300-po und  spik e  just  above.  It  looked  funk y.  I  didn't  know  the  nu mber s  but  figu red  the Nose  had  been  clim bed  at  least  twenty  times  by  then,  so  all  the  loose  stuff  must  have  been  long  gone.  Not  so.  When  Ron  gr abbed  that  spik e,  it  piv- oted  stra ight  down, and  I  still  don't  know  why  he  and  the  spike  didn't land  in  my  lap.  Who  knows  what  kept  it  in  place  before  we came along.  The adage  is:  Never  trust  anyth ing  outright.  Al ways  assume  it's  poor ,  test  it  with  caution,  and  only  use  it  when  you 'r e  convinced  it's  good.  Guides  at  many  trad areas  report  that  many  accid ents  are  the  result  of  beginner s  aggressively  grabbing  loose  rock features  without  fi rst  cautiously  testi ng  them.  Assume  such  features  are  poor ,  and  avoid  becoming  a  statistic.  A  boss  is  a  rounded  spike  or  knob;  a  chickenhead  is  a knob  that  often  resem­ bles  a  pr otr uding mushr oom;  and  a  bal­ lard is  a  hum mock  of  rock.

Common  sense  and  sticking to the  advice  alr eady  laid  down  is  key  here. Is the  feature  strong?  Th ump  it.  Are  there  shar p  edges? Is  it  cracked?  And  how big is it?

Is  the  stone  set  in  a  bot tleneck  or  a  constriction?  Will  downward  loading  decrease  or  increase  its  pur chase?  After  considering  these  poin ts,  apply  the  same  rules concerning  horns,  bloc ks,  flakes,  etc.  Are  ther e  sharp  edges?  What  is  the  qual ity of  the  rock?  If  all  things  look  good,  but  the  positi oning  is  susp ect,  wiggle  the  stone  around and secur e a  better  seating  if  need  be,  but  be  careful  not  to  dislodge  it.  This is  a  very real concern with  bigger  cho ckst ones,  and  if  the  thing  blo ws,  it's  bombs  away!  Pay  close  atte ntion  to  how you  sling  the  chockstone.  Often even the  sli ghtest  tension  can  cause  the  chockstone  to  wobble or  rotate  inside  the  crack,  and  the  sling  can  creep  between  the  stone and  the  wall  and  get stu ck-o r  sometimes  even  NA TUR AL  ANCHORS  31  \nA  gn  th- h1tched  chocl- .s tone  Mak�  sure  the  h1tch  1s  t1ght  al\\lunr.l  the c.hockstone  and  pull e;i  snug  agam�t  1tself  so  1t  won·t  shp  1f  stressed  pass  between  the  stone  and  the  wa ll.

Getti ng  them  well  slung  is  often  the  har dest  part.  Again  the  gir th-hitch  is  usually  the  first  option.  Though  infreq uent,  some  chockstones  are  clearly  so  bombpr oof  that  the re's  no  budging  them  noh ow.  In  these  rare  situations  some  guides  gi rth-hitch  the  chock­ stone  with  a  sli ng,  jamming  the  sling 's  overhand  knot  between  the  main  wall  and  the  cho cksto ne. The  idea is  to  try  to  distribu te  any  loading  between  the  knot in the  sling  (which  is  acting  like  a  nu t)  and  the  chock stone  around which the sling is  hitched.  Though  I've  never  see this  technique  used  in  the field,  such  is  the  impr ovi­ sation  common  to  all facets  of  anchor  build ing.  32  CLIMBING  ANCHOR S",

The  point  is  that  what  the  tree  is  rooted  in  is  probably  more  crucial than the  breadth  of the tree  itself.  Good-sized  trees  have  pulle d  out;  the  big  one  atop the  fi rst  pitch of  a  route called  Catchy,  at  the  Cookie  Cl iff  in  Yo semite,  being  a  case  in  point. While  ther e  is  lik ely  no  single  and  rel iable  way  for  a  clim ber  to  know  or  test  how  well  a  tree is  rooted,  we'r e left  to do  a  thorough  inspection,  including  shaking  the tree  to  check  for  movement. While  some  books  have  su ggested  various  forestry  str ategies  to  establish  the  holding  power  of  trees,  no  two trees  are  the  same.  I' ve  per sonally  hooked  a  tractor  to  a  tree  no  thicker  than  my  arm  and only  managed  to  break  a  chain  in  trying  to  yard  out  the  implacable  pine.  I've  also seen  trees  big  ar ound  as  a  pick le  barrel  come  totally  upr ooted  after  a  thunder  sh ower.  Neverth eless  we  need  a  few  prov isional  guideline s  to  help  guide  our  choices.  First,  you  want  a  live  tree,  prefer ably  6  inches  or  mor e  in diam eter,  not  one  that's  been  choppe d  or  burned  or  is  rotte n.  Any  tree  rooted  in  shallo w  soil,  gravel,  scree, moss or soot,  or  that's  burgeoning  from  a  slim  crack,  should  be  consider ed  suspec t.  If  you've  no  other  choice  for  an  anchor -or  even  if  you  have-test  the  tree  with  a  solid  shak e.  Boot it,  try  to  rip  it  out.  If  it sti ll  feels  sound,  it  probably  is.  Remem ber , of  course,  that  a  serious  leader  fall  can  gener ate  much  mor e  im pact  force  than  a  yank on the tree.  Whenever  poss ible,  tie  the  tree  off  with  sli ngs  or  a  cordele tte  ins tead  of  looping  the  rope  around  the  trunk.  Once  you get  sap  on  a  rope,  it's  lik e a  bum  rap  or mem­ orie s  of  lo ve- you  just  can't  shak e  it.  Plus,  the  pivoting  action  common  when  lean­ ing  off  the  anchor  can  quic kly  abrade  the  sheath  of  a  rope.  Go  with  ru nner s  or  a  nylon  cordele tte.  Unle ss  the  tree  is  truly  a  whopper ,  tie  it  off  as  low  as  possible  to  reduce  lever ­ age.  Never  tie  off  a  tree  with  a  loop  of  biner s.  Girth-hitched  runner s or a  cordele tte  are  both  popul ar  methods  {see  photos  and  ill ustrat ions).  A  cordele tte  is longer  than most  sling s,  negating  the  need  to  girth-hitch  two  slin gs  togeth er  to  reach  arou nd  the  tree.

    "8": "SHRUBS  AND  BUSHES  Anyone  who  has  tried  to  clear  Grandm a's  backyard  under sta nds  the  hateful  toil  of  upr ooting  healthy  shrubs  and  bushes.  Henc e,  they  often  make  good  an chors.  As a  general  rule,  it  is easier  and  less  time-consuming  to  rig a  tr aditional  anchor ,  pr ovid­ ing one  is  rea dily  available.  But  if  good  nu ts  are  problematic  to  set,  and  a  shrub,  bush  or sapling  is  at  hand,  consider  using it.  Aga in,  you  want live  stuff.  Nothing  brittle,  charred,  rotten  or  loose  will  do.  And  mak e  sur e  the  stuff  is  well-rooted.  Most  of  the  ti me  a  shr ub or  bush  issue s  from  a  central  root, and  that's  what  you  want  to  slin g.  Try  to  get  the  sling  around  that  chubby  root  as  nea r  to  the  base  as  possible,  and  cinch  it  down  snug.  It  is  very  sk etchy to  trust a  sol itary  bush  or  shrub,  and  since  they  tend  to  grow  in  clumps,  tying  off  to  three  or  four (or mor e)  and  equalizing  these  anchor s  (to  be  explained  later)  is  smart  rigging.  Mor e  times than not  you'll  have  to  ferret  around  and  push  sometim es-th orny  li mbs aside  to get at  the  main  root.  Do  so.  Never  settle  for less  than  the  best  and  leas t-leveraged  tie-of f  you  can  manage.  And  al ways  test  the  bush  or  shrub  with  a  hea rty  yank.

BOULDERS  AND  BLOCKS  These  can  provide  sound,  quick  anch ors  if  several  things  check  out,  and  you  follow  a  few rules  of  thumb.  Fir st,  realize  that  both  bould ers  and  bl ocks  are  not  part  of  the  body of  the  cl iff.  They  are  det ached, and  the only  thing  keeping  them  in  place is  their  size,  weight  and position.  For  a  boulder  or  blo ck  to  be  any  good  at  all,  it  must  be  both  suf fi ciently  big and  positioned  in  a  way  that  it  cannot be  moved.  It  should  not  wiggle  or  budge  at  all.  Anyo ne  who has  tr und led boulde rs  off  a  remote  slab  knows  that  a  boulder  big  as  a  house  can  be  sent  on  a  path  of  mind -boggl ing  destruction  if  it's  on  even  the  sligh test  grade.

To  their  ho rror,  the  knot  on  the  sling  came  untied,  and  the  entire  rack  dropped  into  the  void.  That  left  them  with  about  eight  nuts  and  assor ted  pegs  filched  from  the  bottom  of  the  haul  bag,  and  the very  anchor  from  which  they  dan­ gled. They  also  were  able  to  clean  a  couple  nea rby  fixed  pin s,  but the  last pitches  were  ex tremely  touch-and-go  as  they  leap frogged  along, sometimes able  to  climb  but  50  feet  before  having to  stop  and  belay  in  a  weird  and  peri lous  spot,  some- 17  \ntimes  \"anchored\"  and hauling  from a  si ngle  wired  nut.

Simpl y  put,  you  sele ct  a  section  of  crack,  and  place  in that crack a  pr otecti on  device  of  corres ponding  size.  The  pr ocess  is  not  terribly  unlik e  working  those  wooden  puzzles  when  we  were  kids  and  we  stuck  the  big  star  into  the  big  star-s haped  hole.  Sin ce  the  size  of  the  crack  dic tates  what  gear  can  be  used,  you  instantly can  elimina te  all  gear  out side  a  specific  size  range.  If  you'r e  look ing  at  a  ha lf -inch  crack,  you  have  only  to  consider  options that  can  possibly  fit that crack.  Much  mor e  on  this  later .

In  these  cases,  an  anchor  may  be  secured  by  sli nging  the  natural  feature.  Of  cour se,  an  ever -increasing  num ber  of  face  routes  have  been  equipped  with  bolts,  and  obtaining  anc hors  on  these  fixed  routes  req uir es  only  clipping  into  the  bolt  hang er,  negating the  need  to  place any  gear  at  all.  But  when  the  anchor  involves  hand-placing  gear  in  a  crack  or  rigging  sling s  about  natural  features,  the  main  goal  is  to  obtain  the  strongest  anchor  possible  from  the  given  crack  or  feature.  \nNatural  anchor s  consist  of  anyth ing  that  the  envi­ ronment  provid es- trees,  blocks,  horns  of  rock,  etc.  Many times  a  natural  anchor  is  stronger  than  anything  you  could  arrange with  store- bought  gear .

TREES  Anchoring  to  a  50-fo ot  oak  that  casts  a  shadow  lik e a  thundercloud  is  pretty  str aig htforward  work.  Ju dgment  enter s  the  game  once  the trees  become  smaller  and  ar e  located  on  top  of  the  cl iff,  on  ledges  and on she lves.  I've  seen  some  ana ly­ ses  of  which  trees  are  best  suited  for  use  as  anch ors;  some  of  these  go  so  fa r  as  to  study  the  indi vidual  gr ain  of  the  tree.  But  most  of  this-and  everyth ing else  for that  matter -basically  boils  down  to  common  sense.  Still  there  are several  consid era­ tions  worth  noting.  Some  clim ber s  thi nk  anyth ing  with  bark  on it  is  bomber ,  and  the  infamous  To bin  Sorrenson  was  one  of  them.

Arizona,  but a scrappy  li ttle  cl iff  outside  Amb oy,  Calif ornia,  that has  fo r  years  been  closed  to  climbing. (An old  rummy  with  a  12 -gauge  fu ll  of  rock salt  sta nds  guard,  in  case  you'r e  wondering.)  To bin  was leading  up  one  of  those  greasy,  teete ring  slabs  that  look  lik e  you  could  make  good  time  up  it  in flip  flops, when  in  fact  your  only hope  is  to  keep  your  $15 0  boo ts  bicycling  lik e  Wile  E.  Coyote.  When  I  clawed  up  to  To bin' s  belay  and  saw  the  anchor , I  lost  my  mind.  \"What  the hell  is  that,  To bin?!\"  20  CL IMBING  ANCHOR S  \n\"It 's  a  tree  ....  \"  I'd  shot  pool  with a  bigger  \"tree\"  than this  one .  \"Th at's  not a tree,  it's  a  twig.  A dead  twig.\"  And  it  was  sti cking  out  of  a  clump  of  orange  moss  on an  angled,  shaly  li ttle  footh old  stance.  I  reached  over  and  yanked  the sad  thing  out  with  about  ten  pounds  of heft.  \"Jesus!  Yo u  trying to  kill  us  or  something?!\"  To bin  cried.  The  point  is  that  what  the  tree  is  rooted  in  is  probably  more  crucial than the  breadth  of the tree  itself.  Good-sized  trees  have  pulle d  out;  the  big  one  atop the  fi rst  pitch of  a  route called  Catchy,  at  the  Cookie  Cl iff  in  Yo semite,  being  a  case  in  point. While  ther e  is  lik ely  no  single  and  rel iable  way  for  a  clim ber  to  know  or  test  how  well  a  tree is  rooted,  we'r e left  to do  a  thorough  inspection,  including  shaking  the tree  to  check  for  movement. While  some  books  have  su ggested  various  forestry  str ategies  to  establish  the  holding  power  of  trees,  no  two trees  are  the  same.  I' ve  per sonally  hooked  a  tractor  to  a  tree  no  thicker  than  my  arm  and only  managed  to  break  a  chain  in  trying  to  yard  out  the  implacable  pine.  I've  also seen  trees  big  ar ound  as  a  pick le  barrel  come  totally  upr ooted  after  a  thunder  sh ower.  Neverth eless  we  need  a  few  prov isional  guideline s  to  help  guide  our  choices.  First,  you  want  a  live  tree,  prefer ably  6  inches  or  mor e  in diam eter,  not  one  that's  been  choppe d  or  burned  or  is  rotte n.  Any  tree  rooted  in  shallo w  soil,  gravel,  scree, moss or soot,  or  that's  burgeoning  from  a  slim  crack,  should  be  consider ed  suspec t.  If  you've  no  other  choice  for  an  anchor -or  even  if  you  have-test  the  tree  with  a  solid  shak e.  Boot it,  try  to  rip  it  out.  If  it sti ll  feels  sound,  it  probably  is.  Remem ber , of  course,  that  a  serious  leader  fall  can  gener ate  much  mor e  im pact  force  than  a  yank on the tree.  Whenever  poss ible,  tie  the  tree  off  with  sli ngs  or  a  cordele tte  ins tead  of  looping  the  rope  around  the  trunk.  Once  you get  sap  on  a  rope,  it's  lik e a  bum  rap  or mem­ orie s  of  lo ve- you  just  can't  shak e  it.  Plus,  the  pivoting  action  common  when  lean­ ing  off  the  anchor  can  quic kly  abrade  the  sheath  of  a  rope.  Go  with  ru nner s  or  a  nylon  cordele tte.  Unle ss  the  tree  is  truly  a  whopper ,  tie  it  off  as  low  as  possible  to  reduce  lever ­ age.  Never  tie  off  a  tree  with  a  loop  of  biner s.  Girth-hitched  runner s or a  cordele tte  are  both  popul ar  methods  {see  photos  and  ill ustrat ions).  A  cordele tte  is longer  than most  sling s,  negating  the  need  to  girth-hitch  two  slin gs  togeth er  to  reach  arou nd  the  tree.  Although arr anging  a  gir th-hitch  to  conn ect  two  slin gs  is  simple  as  ra in,  a  recent  ra pp el  ling  accident  in  Arizona cost  a  won derful  young  woman  When  anchoring  to  a  tree  .. .  •  Make  sure  t  a!l, , e  •  Use  slings  or  a  ordelette  111stead of  rope  to  tie it  off  •  Tie  It  off  as  low  as  po!>Sib!e  to  reduce  leverage.

But  if  good  nu ts  are  problematic  to  set,  and  a  shrub,  bush  or sapling  is  at  hand,  consider  using it.  Aga in,  you  want live  stuff.  Nothing  brittle,  charred,  rotten  or  loose  will  do.  And  mak e  sur e  the  stuff  is  well-rooted.  Most  of  the  ti me  a  shr ub or  bush  issue s  from  a  central  root, and  that's  what  you  want  to  slin g.  Try  to  get  the  sling  around  that  chubby  root  as  nea r  to  the  base  as  possible,  and  cinch  it  down  snug.  It  is  very  sk etchy to  trust a  sol itary  bush  or  shrub,  and  since  they  tend  to  grow  in  clumps,  tying  off  to  three  or  four (or mor e)  and  equalizing  these  anchor s  (to  be  explained  later)  is  smart  rigging.  Mor e  times than not  you'll  have  to  ferret  around  and  push  sometim es-th orny  li mbs aside  to get at  the  main  root.  Do  so.  Never  settle  for less  than  the  best  and  leas t-leveraged  tie-of f  you  can  manage.  And  al ways  test  the  bush  or  shrub  with  a  hea rty  yank.  Unless  you  test  it  and  test  it  good,  you  might  be  tyi ng  off  someth ing  no  more  secur e  than  a  tumble weed  on  a  bridal  path.  BOULDERS  AND  BLOCKS  These  can  provide  sound,  quick  anch ors  if  several  things  check  out,  and  you  follow  a  few rules  of  thumb.  Fir st,  realize  that  both  bould ers  and  bl ocks  are  not  part  of  the  body of  the  cl iff.  They  are  det ached, and  the only  thing  keeping  them  in  place is  their  size,  weight  and position.  For  a  boulder  or  blo ck  to  be  any  good  at  all,  it  must  be  both  suf fi ciently  big and  positioned  in  a  way  that  it  cannot be  moved.  It  should  not  wiggle  or  budge  at  all.

I  didn't  know  the  nu mber s  but  figu red  the Nose  had  been  clim bed  at  least  twenty  times  by  then,  so  all  the  loose  stuff  must  have  been  long  gone.  Not  so.  When  Ron  gr abbed  that  spik e,  it  piv- oted  stra ight  down, and  I  still  don't  know  why  he  and  the  spike  didn't land  in  my  lap.  Who  knows  what  kept  it  in  place  before  we came along.  The adage  is:  Never  trust  anyth ing  outright.  Al ways  assume  it's  poor ,  test  it  with  caution,  and  only  use  it  when  you 'r e  convinced  it's  good.  Guides  at  many  trad areas  report  that  many  accid ents  are  the  result  of  beginner s  aggressively  grabbing  loose  rock features  without  fi rst  cautiously  testi ng  them.  Assume  such  features  are  poor ,  and  avoid  becoming  a  statistic.  A  boss  is  a  rounded  spike  or  knob;  a  chickenhead  is  a knob  that  often  resem­ bles  a  pr otr uding mushr oom;  and  a  bal­ lard is  a  hum mock  of  rock.  The  bigger  they are,  the  more  probable  it  is  that  they  are  sou nd-but  not  alw ays .  Depending  on  the  shape  of  the  knob,  the  ha rdest  part might  be  figuring  out  how  to  tie  it  off.  The  mor e  ro unde d,  the  less  secure.  The  girth-hitch  is  usually  help ful  here.  A  chickenhead  is  as  shady  as  a  felon  on bail.  Approach  it  with  wariness.  They  usually  consist of  a  miner al  or  rock  type  that  is  more  resistant  to  weath ering  than the underlying  stone.

Ultimately  common  sense  and  a  suspicious  sense  of  ju dg­ ment  are  your  best  weapons  when  deal ing  with  all  natural  features.  THREADING  TUNNELS  Whe n  the rock  weather s  or  cracks  to  form  a  hole  in the  main  wa ll,  climb ers  often  can  exploit  the  feature  by  threa ding  a  slin g  through  the  cavit y.  Common  sense  and  sticking to the  advice  alr eady  laid  down  is  key  here. Is the  feature  strong?  Th ump  it.  Are  there  shar p  edges? Is  it  cracked?  And  how big is it?  Occasionally  something  as  small  as  a  suit case  handle  can  pr ovi de  adequa te  pr otecti on.  Anyth ing  less should  be  used  cautious ly,  no  matter  how stout  it  app ears.  A  tunnE'I  g1rth-hit chr.d  w1th  a  runner .  CHOCKSTONES  Any rock  lodged  inside  a  crack  is  a  chockstone.  You  appraise  the  secu rity  of  the  chock stone  just  as you  would  that of  a  nu t-does  the  stone's  symm etry  corre­ spond  to  that  of  the  slo t?  Is  the  stone  set  in  a  bot tleneck  or  a  constriction?  Will  downward  loading  decrease  or  increase  its  pur chase?  After  considering  these  poin ts,  apply  the  same  rules concerning  horns,  bloc ks,  flakes,  etc.  Are  ther e  sharp  edges?  What  is  the  qual ity of  the  rock?  If  all  things  look  good,  but  the  positi oning  is  susp ect,  wiggle  the  stone  around and secur e a  better  seating  if  need  be,  but  be  careful  not  to  dislodge  it.  This is  a  very real concern with  bigger  cho ckst ones,  and  if  the  thing  blo ws,  it's  bombs  away!  Pay  close  atte ntion  to  how you  sling  the  chockstone.  Often even the  sli ghtest  tension  can  cause  the  chockstone  to  wobble or  rotate  inside  the  crack,  and  the  sling  can  creep  between  the  stone and  the  wall  and  get stu ck-o r  sometimes  even  NA TUR AL  ANCHORS  31  \nA  gn  th- h1tched  chocl- .s tone  Mak�  sure  the  h1tch  1s  t1ght  al\\lunr.l  the c.hockstone  and  pull e;i  snug  agam�t  1tself  so  1t  won·t  shp  1f  stressed  pass  between  the  stone  and  the  wa ll.  Chock stones  are  infrequently  used  because  they rarely  meet  the  above  requir ements,  and  can  be  problematic  even  if  they  do.  Getti ng  them  well  slung  is  often  the  har dest  part.  Again  the  gir th-hitch  is  usually  the  first  option.  Though  infreq uent,  some  chockstones  are  clearly  so  bombpr oof  that  the re's  no  budging  them  noh ow.  In  these  rare  situations  some  guides  gi rth-hitch  the  chock­ stone  with  a  sli ng,  jamming  the  sling 's  overhand  knot  between  the  main  wall  and  the  cho cksto ne. The  idea is  to  try  to  distribu te  any  loading  between  the  knot in the  sling  (which  is  acting  like  a  nu t)  and  the  chock stone  around which the sling is  hitched.  Though  I've  never  see this  technique  used  in  the field,  such  is  the  impr ovi­ sation  common  to  all facets  of  anchor  build ing.  32  CLIMBING  ANCHOR S",
