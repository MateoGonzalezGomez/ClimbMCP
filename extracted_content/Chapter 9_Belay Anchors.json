In  the  past the  basic  rigging  methods  included  the  cordele tte,  the  slidin g  X  and  the  crafty  use  of  sli�g s  and  clo ve  hitches.  Recent  tests,  ho wever ,  have  det ermined  that  the  cordele tte  is  dependabl e  only  when  the  arms  of  the  system  are  of  pe rfect  leng th.  The  equale tte, a  new  variation  of  the  cordel ette,  is  showing promise  as  a  viable  replacement  and  has  thus  far  received  solid  reviews  following  extensive  field testing. No  doub t  other  systems  will  evolve  over  time  as  mor e  climb ers try  to  solve the  long st anding  problem  of  achieving  redunda ncy  and  good  equal ization with  lim ited  ext ension.  The  pho tos  in  this  chapter  show examples  of  typical  anchoring  setups.  Memo­ rizing  the  rigging  on  a  given belay anchor doesn't  mean  you'll  be  able  to  (or  want  to)  use  the  exact  same method  at  a  di ffe rent  locati on.  The  pho tos  simpl y  allow  you  to  study  various  setups and  develop  a  working  under st anding  of  general  principles.  When  studying  the  photos,  try  to  qu ickly  recognize  what  basic  technique  is  used,  then  cons ider  options  and  mentally formulate  ways  you  mi ght  do  things  dif ferently.  When  building  any belay  anchor , yo u'll  alw ays  face  lim itati ons.  A  leader  can  take  onl y  so  muc h  gear  on  her  rack,  and  it's  imp oss ible  to  predic t  what  gear  she  will place  to  pr otect  a  given  pitch.  Whatever  gear  remains  on  your  rack  at  the  end  of the  pitch  is  what  you  have  to  efficiently  and  securely  fas hion  a  bela y.  If  you  don't  thoroughly  under stand the ba sic  princip les,  you  will  struggle  to  build  anchor s  with  limi ted  gear .

The  dir ections  of  pull  will  influence  your  rigging  choices  per  building  a  statica ll y  equali zed  or  dynamically  equalized  anchor  syste m.  After  de term ining  the  possible  dir ections  of  pull,  locate  where  you  want  to  bel ay- what  physical  location  is best  for  tending  the  line,  what  affo rds  the  most  secu re  and  ergo nomic  stance,  what  allo ws  use  of  the  re maining  gear  on  your  rack,  etc.  If  adequa te  primary  placeme nts  aren't  available,  consider  moving  the  station  higher  if  possible,  or  lower  if  necessa ry.  Often  you  won't have  a  choice.  There  will  be  only  a  small  shelf  or  one  crack.  Mos t  belay  anchor s  are  buil t  around  one atomic  bombpr oof  nut  or  SLCD,  and  that 's  task  number  one:  setti ng  the  str ongest,  most  obvious big  nut  or  camming  device  you  can  arrange.  If  extra  stout  placem ents  abound,  go  with  the  one  most  handil y  lo cated,  ideally  about  chest  level,  where  you  can  remain  st anding ,  can  hang  the  rack  and  can  keep  an  eye  on the  whole  works.

Whatever  the  situati on,  the  prio rity  is  to  sink  that  first,  bom bpr oof  pl acement.  No  matter  if  you're  st anding  on  a 1  0- by 1 a­ foot  te rrace,  clip  into th is  piece  before  you  finish  rigging  the  belay  anchor  and  before  you  go  off  bel ay.  Next,  shor e  up the  primar y  placement  with  secondar y  pl ac em ents,  striving  to  keep  the  gr ouping  close  by,  but  not  so  close  that they are  cro wding  each  other.  If  the  rock  qual ity  is  less  than  per fect,  spread  the  anchor s  out,  using  several  features,  to  preser ve  redundanc y.  Don't  put all  your  eggs  in one basket. Try  to  make  the  placement  closest  to  you  {first  to  be  loaded  in  event  of  an  upward  pull)  mul tidir ec­ tional  by  using  an  SLCD  if  possible.  Remember  you  want  an  effi cient  anc hor ,  not  sim ply  one  that  will  bear  the  most  imp act.  The  placem ents  should  be  str aigh tfo rwa rd  to  place  and  remove  and  should  be  as  centr all y  located  as  possib le-a  ni ce,  tight gr ouping ,  as  opposed  to  an  entangling  web  of tackle  crisscrossing  the  stat ion.  Personal ly,  I  like  to  place  a  minimum  of  four  pieces:  three  in  the  downward  dir ection  and  if  the  situation  req uir es,  one  upward  placement  opposing  the pri­ mary  an c hor .  Sometimes  three  are  enough,  and  sometimes  that's  all  yo u'll  get.  Anyth ing  less  is  a  crapshoot.  And  accept that  some times  yo u'll  be  shooting  craps.  The  rock  will  not  alw ays  affo rd  instant  and  bomber  belay  anchors.  Yo u  sometimes  have  to  work  at  get ting  an yth ing appr oaching  \"good  enough .\"  Once  the  primary  placemen ts  are  set,  you  must  conn ect  the  various  compo­ nents  together  so  they function  as  one  unit.  This  is  often  the  most critical,  and  dif fi­ cult,  par t  of  the  whole  procedure.  Several  possibilities  exist for  connecting  the  2.

For  now  re member  that,  if  possible,  the  bela yer's  body  should  remain  in  line  between  the  anchor s  and  the  antici pated  dir ection  of  pull.  Those  are  the  basics .  Let's  dig  into  the  par ti cular s.  TY ING  IN TO  THE  BE LAY  ANCHOR  The  standard  method  of  tymg  Into  the  a11chor  is via  a  f1gur e  eight  on  a  bight  clipped  mto  the  power  pomt  (see  upcom 1ng  text)  with  a  locking  bin er,  or  two  biner\"  w1th  the  gates  opposed  Once  a  team  gPts  er;tabhsh�d on  a  mult1p1tch  chmb,  howeve r,  the  method  of  tymg  m  depends  on  at  least  two  facto r s .  (1)  the  number  of  climber s  on  the  team,  and  (2)  whether  or  not  more  than  one  perc;on  is  domg  the  leading .  Out  in  the  field  you'll  see  folks tying  into  the  powAr  point  with  a  single  clovE- hitch,  two  clove  hitches ,  a  clove  hitch  and  i!  f1gur e  e1ght (to mL!Itiple  power  pom ts),  a  da1sy  chain,  d  shng  or  two  or  three,  an  adJ•Jst ai.Jie  link  of  rope  and  a  Ropeman  ascender ,  and  countless  other  methods .  Many  of  these  techmques  �re  as  sketchy  as  a  felon  on  bail,  none  so  much  as  attaching  yourself  w1th  a  dai sy  chain,  wh1ch  cre3tes  a stat1c  connection  th::�t  sacnfices  the  considerable  strength,  give and flex  offe red  by  tyir.g  in  wrth  the  dynamic  climbing  rope  The  dim  of  esta blishing  a  pr otocol  on  tying m  IS  to facil itate  the smooth and  !>ecure  transitior. from  climbing  to  b<-laying  to  climbmg  agam  If,  for  m�an ce, ;,;  two-person  party  is  swinging  leads,  the  process  IS  fairly  straight forward .  If  you  are  a  three-per­ son  party  with  one  person  doin'!l\"  the  leading,  or  if  the  leading  and the  f.:>llowmg  rs  done  in  no  partrcular  order,  the  belay  can  qu1 ckly  betome  a  hateful  mess if  you  don't  have  a  simple  and  rehi:lble  system  for  tying  in�o  the  anchor .  Ther · e  are  no  hard  and  fa�.t,  standardized  me thods  m  this  wo;k  because  the  c-onf iguratiOn  of  b�lay s  is  so  var�ed  It  will  tal-:e  practice  to  come  up  with  your  own  eft1 cr.:!nt  system .  There  are,  however,  some  basic  str ategies  that work  in  most  Ins tances  One  good  strategy  IS  to  back  up  your  conn ec.ti on .  If  you tie  rnto  the  power  point  with  a  cl ove  hitch,  tit'  mto  another  point  of  th�  anchor  with  a  figur e  eight  on  a  bight  The  most  bomber  piece  is  a  good choicE:  for·  this  backup .  If  you're  using  a  cordelette  to  connect  the  anc-hor  pi  aces,  another  potential  backup  pornt  rs  the  \"shelf\"  of  the  cordel ette ,  whrch  is  the  pomt  nght  t�bove  the  power  pornt .  This  ··shelr'  also  offe rs  an  alternative clip-m  spot  for  whoever  IS  leading  the  next  pitch  in  ::1  group  of  three  or  more .  The  pr actice  results  rn  one  less  tie-in dt  the  power  point,  thereby  op enmg  it  L'P  for  other s  to  chp  in,  and  It  al lows  the  leader  to  qurckly  unchp  and  take off on  the  next pitch  Th e  Enigm a  of  Fa ctor  2  Fa lls  As  we've  learned,  lab  drop  tests  determ ined  that  a  factor  2  fall  creates  the  greatest  force  that  can  ever  be  put  on  a  roped safety  syste m.  Though  we've  seen  that  a  real  world  factor  2  fall  gener ates  forces  that  are  less than those  registered  in  the  lab  drop  test,  the  pa rty  line  re mains  the  same:  If  a  belay  cannot  sust ain  a  factor  2  fa ll,  14 4  CLI MBING  ANCHOR S  \nit  is  not  \"good  enough.\"  And  yet  the  vast  majority  of  the  most  experienced  climb ers  on  the  planet have  li ttle  dir ect  experience  with  a  worst-case  scenario,  fac­ tor  2  fa ll.  American  climber and  mathematics  pr ofessor  Richar d  Gol dstone  pu ts  it  this  way:  \"My  sense  is  that circumstances  severe  enough  to  result  in  total anchor  fail­ ur e  have  happened  in  the  field  to  no  more than  a  handful  of  climbe rs  dur ing  the  nearly  forty -nine  years  I've  been  climbi ng.\"  Cr aig  Connally  says  the  same  th ing  another  way:  \"The  reason  ther e's  so  much  sc rewy  advice  about  fa lls  and  anchor  building  is  that  the  roped  safety  system  hardly  ever  gets  stres sed  to its  limi ts.\"  If  tr aditional  wisdom  insis ts  that  we  build  belay  anchor s  to  sust ain  a  factor  2  fa ll,  and  precious  few  of  our  anchor s  have ever  sustained  anyth ing  close  to  such  loading,  on  what real world  experiences  and on  what  hard information  are  we  bas­ ing  our  rec ommenda tions?  While  ther e  is  a  glaring  lack  of  defin itive  information  about  real  world  anchors,  this  lack  is  som ewhat  countered  by  field  testing  carried  out  by  milli ons  of  climbe rs  annuall y.  Un for tuna tely  for  our  discus sion,  but  fortunately  for  climbe rs,  the  bulk  of  this  field  testi ng  ent ails  fall  forces  in  the  factor  .3  to  .5 ra nge.  Better  to  have  a  lar ge,  contr olled  database  on  factor  2  falls that  could  tell  us  what  tech ni ques  worked  and  what  did  not  so  we  could  base  our  re comme ndations on  that data.  As  it  sta nds,  we  must  dr aw  our  information  from  a  di ffe rent,  and  adm itte dly ,  shallo wer  we ll.  That  said,  we  were able  to  in itiate  an  extensive  series  of  lab  tests  specifically  for  this  book,  and  the  test  results yielded  inv aluable  information  about  rigging  sys tems.  This  is  only  a  sta rt,  ho wever .  Many  mor e tests  by many  more  people  are  req uired  to  wrestle  with  this  very  slip pery  sub ject.  Spreading  the  Load  A  fa ll  gener ates  forces,  and  you  want  the  im pact  of  those  forces  equali zed  over  and  absorbed  throughout  the  entire  anchor  matrix.  A  wise  stockbroker  has  a  broad  por t­ fol io.  He  doesn't  toss  all  his  dough  into  a  single  fund,  no  matter  how  blue  the  chip.  Same  thing  with  belay  an chors.  We  spread  the  load  over several  sound  primar y  placem ents  and  reduce  the  possibil ity  that the  whole  matrix  will  fai l.  And that is,  and  al ways  wiil  be, the  primar y  function  of  a  belay  anchor -to  hold no  matter  what.  We've  all had  pr o  rip  out;  some  of  us  have  had two  poi nts  of  pr o  rip out.  But  it's  unlik ely  you  will  ever  read  about  a  fa ile d  anc hor  that  was  set  in  good  rock,  well­ equal ized,  red undant  and  fa shioned  to  absorb  loading  in  the  dir ection  of  the  pull.  Three  or  fo ur  bomber  nuts  and  SLCDs,  judi ciously  equalized  and  set  in  good  rock,  sim ply  are not  going  to  fa il no  matter  how  fa r a  leader  might  fall  on  th em.  Let's  mak e  no  mi stake  about  it:  A  leader  can  gener ate  only  so  much  imp act  force,  and  a  viable  anchor  can  readily sustain  it.  BE LA Y  ANCHOR S  14 5  \nBy  using  oppositional  elem ents  in the  anchor  (if  requi red)  and  proper ly  equal iz­ ing  them to  the  primar y,  bombpr oof  anchors,  the  anchor  becomes  multidir ec­ tional.  You  can  ya nk  and  tug  and  fa ll  on  it  from  many  angles  and  that  baby  will  sti ll  hold.  Again,  th at's  the  bottom  li ne  with  a  belay  anch or-it  must hold,  no  matter  what.  While  we  have  str essed  the  critical  impor ta nce  of  getti ng  a  secur e  placement  just  off  the  bel ay- the  Jesus  Nu t-a nd  have  clar ified  that  the  top  placement  alw ays  sustains  the  hig hest  loading  during  a  fa ll,  we  nevertheless  strive  to  build  our  anchor s  to sustain that  worst-case  scenario  fa ll  because if  all  our  pro  rips  out,  we  still  have  a  str ong and  secur e  anchor  to  save  the  day.  But it's  a  plain  fact: No  ma tter  how  superb  the  rigging,  we  almo st  never  attain  un iform  equa lization  between  primar y  placeme nts  in  the  anc hor  matrix.  At  best  we  ac hie ve  a  somewhat  even  dis tribution  of  loading.  Knowing  that  equal ization  is  a  rel­ ative  term  does  not  keep  us  from  striving  to  build  belay  anch ors  with  the  following  featu res:  •  Distributes  the  load  as  evenly  as  possible  between  the  component  par ts  of  the  anchor  system  •  Has  a  minimum  of  slack  between  the  various  tie-in  poi nts  •  Uses  a  rigging  method  and/or  multidir ecti onal  compo nents  capable  of  se lf-adjust­ ing,  or  automatically  redistributing  the load  as  the  load ing  dir ection  chan ges  (say ,  as  the be  layer  shif ts  position,  or the  belayed  climber  pi tches  off  and  swings,  or  if  the belayer  gets  yanked  up ward)  •  Can  withsta nd  the  greatest  load  a  leader  can  place  upon  it  STAT IC  AND  AUTOMATIC  EQUALIZATION SYSTEMS  There  are  two  kinds  of  equalizing  syste ms:  stat ic,  pseudo -eq ualizing  syste ms  (also  called  pre-eq uali zed  systems) and  automatic  (dynamic  or se lf-adjusting)  syste ms.  The  fo llowing  pages,  pho tos  and  commen tary  explor e  these  syste ms in  detail,  but  to  start  out,  under sta nd  these  shor t  def ini tions:  •  A  static  equalizing  system  refers  to  a  gr ouping  of  nuts,  pitons,  bolts,  etc.,  which  are  tied  off  together  with  no  slack or  adjustabil ity  in  the  sys te m.  For  exa mple,  if  we  have  four  nut s  in  a  line  and  tie  them  all  off  with  a  cordele tte,  the  impa ct  force  will,  to  some  degree,  get  distributed  over  all  four nuts.  Realistical ly,  this  system  pr ovides  im per fect  equal ization,  so  one  of  the  anchor s- the  anchor  conn ected  to  the  shor test  arm  of the  rigging  system-is  inevitably sust aining  mo st  of the  load.  •  An  automatic  equalizing  (dy namid self -adjusting)  system  emplo ys  various  sling  configurations  between  the  anchor s  so  all  pi eces  shar e,  to  greater  or  lesser  degrees,  any  appli ed  load,  even if  the  loading  dir ecti on  changes.  The  use  of  14 6  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nlim iter  knots  to  reduce  ext ension  on  slidin g  X  configurations  creates  something  of  a  hybrid anchor  between  automatic  and  static  equa lization,  but  for  the  purposes  of  this  book,  we  will  consider  those  anchor s  to  be  part  of  this  catego ry.  Some­ times belay anchor s  feature  a  combin ation  of  automatic  and  static  equalizing con­ structs.  For  instance, you  might  end  up  with  several  pairings  of  nu ts  equal ized  with  the  sliding  X,  these  being lashed  together  with  a  cordel ette  or an equale tte  to  create  a  comple te  syste m.  Mode rn  Rigging  Trends  For  many  year s  most  clim bers  tied  dir ectly  into  a  belay  anchor  with  the  lead  rope.  The  rope  tie-in  was  consider ed  the  qui ckest,  simp lest  and least  gear-intensive  method,  and was  used  ten  to  one  over  all  other  setups. About fifteen  year s  ago  the  cordele tte  was  invented  to  spread  the load  quick ly  and  some what  evenly  between  two  bomber  bolts  on  sp ort-cl imb  belay  anchor s.  Over  time  the  cordele tte  became  a  popular  rigging  technique  for trad  climbin g.  The  notion  was  to  maximize  the  overa ll  strength  of  the  anchor  sys tem,  while  red ucing  the  belay  switch-over  time  if  one  climber  was  leading  all  of  the  pitches,  or if  the  pa rty  had  three  or  more  clim ber s.  As  popular  as  the  cordele tte  is,  recent  tes ting  has  shown  that  it does  not  achie ve  an  acceptable  level of  equal ization  when  the  arms of  the  system  are  of  un equal  leng ths.  While  the  cord ele tte  remains  a  viable  rigging  system in  the  equal­ arm  configuration  (connecting  two-a nd  only  two-p lacements).  the  equale tte  is  looking  good  in  both  the lab  and  the  fi eld,  and  it  app ears  to  be  a  logical option  when the  arms  of  the  rigging  system  are  of  unequal  leng th,  and  even  when  they  ar e  not.  Another rigging  method,  built  on  the  sliding  X,  is  also  a  primar y  rigging  strat­ egy.  Mor e  recen tly,  climber s  have started  in tegrati ng  both the  cordele tte  and  the  sliding  X  into  an  anchor  matrix.  For  example,  you  might  equalize  several  place­ ments  with  the  slidin g  X,  then  use  the  cordele tte  to  statically  equali ze  the  power  point.  Because  the  cordel ette,  sliding  X  and  equa lette  are  primary  rigging  techniques,  it's  essential  to  under stand  the  pros  and  cons  of  each.  It  is  here,  in  this  critical  di scussion,  that  the SRENE criteria  jump  to  full  life,  for  only  when  appl ied  can  the  concep ts  be made  clear.  The  reason  for having  started  with  a  discussion  of  climb­ ing  forces  (and  dir ection  of pull)  is  to  help  you  mak e  these  what-if  anal yses  more  con crete.  And  it's  pretty  much  what-if  from  her e  on  out.  Whe.n  to  Use  Wh at  Tr ying  to  est ablish  when  to  use the  equale tte,  sliding  X  or  cordele tte  is  a  sli pper y  business.

Let's  fi rst  look  at  the  cordele tte,  the  mo ther  of  all  rigging  methods for  mor e  than  a  decade.  CORDELETTES  Until  recent  testi ng  showed  its  shor tcomings,  a  cordele tte  was  generally  used  to  di stribute  the  load  between  two,  three  or  fo ur  (rare)  primar y  placem ents  in  a  belay  anc ho r.  The  cordele tte  minimi zes  the  numb er  of  carabiner s,  sl ing s  and  quickdr aws  req uir ed to  connec t  the  placemen ts  in an  anchor  matrix  (u nle ss  you  just  use  the  rope),  thereby  justif ying  its size and weight.  A  sta ndard  cordele tte  consis ts  of  an  18 -f oot  piece  of  5.5mm  high -t ensile  cord  or  7mm nylon and  has been  commonly  used  by  guides  to  create  a  single  poin t  fo r  connecting  cli ents  to  all  the  individual  anchor s  of  a  belay  or as  a  toprope  anchor  sys te m.  The  cordele tte  is  tied  into  a  loop  with  a  tri ple  fisherman' s  knot  (if  using  high­ tensile  cord)  or  a  double  fisherman's  knot  (if  using  nylon cord)  and  clipped  in to  each  of  the  primar y  anchors.  A  loop  of  the  cord  is  then  pulled  down  between  each  of  the  primar y  pieces.  If  you  have  three  pi eces  in  your  belay  anchor ,  you'll  get  three  loops  that  must  then  be  pulled  tight  toward  the  antici pated  loading  dir ection  (di rec tion  of  pull).  As  a  statically  equal ized  syste m,  the  cordele tte  is  designed  to  withst and  forces  in  a  specific  dir ection  of  pull,  and  that  dir ection  must  remain  con- 14 8  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nstant or the  effe ctiveness  of the  cordele tte  is  greatly  compr omi sed.  In  shor t,  rig­ ging  the  cordele tte  in  the  dir ection  of  anticipated  load ing  is  absolu tely  vital.  Align  the  fisherman's  knot  in  the  cordel ette  so  it  is  belo w  the  hig hest  piece  in  the  matrix,  which  keeps the  bulk y  fisherman' s  knot  from  in terf ering  with the  power  point  kn ot-a  common  mi stake  for  beginners.  Next, tie an  ov erhand  knot,  or  if  you  have  enough  cord,  a  figur e  eight  knot,  near  the  tie-in  point  Clipping  a  biner  in  at  this  point  greatly  fa cilit ates  tyi ng  the  knot  with  nice,  equal loops.  Tie  the  power  point  loop about  4  inches  in  diame ter,  roughly  the  same  size  as  the belay loop  on  your  ha rness.  The  cordele tte  has  now  formed  three  separ ate,  redundant  loops that  offe r  no  exte nsion  if one of  the  primar y  placem ents  fails.  The  problem with  this  con­ figuration  is  the  issue  of  equal­ izat ion.  Lab  tests  clearly  show  that  un less  the  cordele tte  is  conf igur ed  with  per fectly  equal­ leng th  arms  it  does  not  achie ve  a  remotely  ad equate  de gree  of  equali zation  between  the  pri­ mar y  placem ents .  Instead the  bulk  of  any  loading  is  absorbed  by  the  shor test  arm  in  the  sys­ tem.  He nce  the  cordele tte  works  best  in  those  situations  where  it  can  be  configured  with  equal-leng th  arms and con­ nected to  side -by-s ide  place­ me nts  (such  as  bo lts  atop  a  sport  climb),  and  also  where the  dir ection of  pull  remains  a  con­ stant-stra ight  up and  straight  down .

This  provides  a  mor e  dynamic  system and  allo ws  quick  escape  if  need  be.  Alw ays  make sure  the  rope  remains  the  primar y  att achm ent,  owing  to  it's  dyna mic  (stretch)  properties. One  disturbing,  recent  trend  (and  pr oba­ bly  90  per cent  of  novice trad  clim ber s  do  this)  is  to  use  a  da isy chain  for  your  atta chment.  This  static  conn ection- which  daisy chain  man ufactu rers  warn  agains t- pr ecludes  the  climbing  rope  from  acting  as  a  shock  abso rber.  In  the  dou­ ble  fata lit y  on  The  Step  at  Ta hqu itz  Rock,  the  be  layer was  atta ched  to  the  cordele tte  with  a  small  length  of  hig h-t ensile  cord,  rath er  than  with  the  main  rope.  Never  do  so.  In  summar y,  when  the  primar y  placements  of  the belay  anc hor  are  of  equal  dis­ tance  from  the  power  point  and  bomb er,  and  the  dir ection  of  possible  loading  (pull)  remains  constant,  a  statically  equalized setup  lik e  the  cordele tte  is  a  viable  choice.  Again,  the  bi ggest  shor tc oming  of  the  cordele tt e---o ne  that keeps some  clim be rs  from  using  the  cordel ette  at  al l-is  that  it  loses  almo st  all,  if  not all,  of  its  equal ization  properties  if  the  loading  dir ection  changes.  In  shor t,  a  cordele tte  sac­ rifices  equali zation  pr operties  if it  is  im pacted  in  a  dir ection  for  which  it is not  rigged,  and  to  a  lesser  degree,  in  the  dir ecti on  for  which it was rigged.

With practice,  rigging  anchor s  with  cordele ttes  becomes  quick  and  strai ghtforwa rd.  Cordelettes  and  Equa lizatio n-an  Ex ample  Because  the  cordele tte  was  for  many  years  a  favored  rigging  strategy  and  because  we  are  now  su ggesting  otherwise  in  many situations,  it  is  worthwh ile  to  under ­ stand  the  entire  pic ture.  You  will  certa inl y  hear  strong  re comme ndations  for  using  the  cordele tte  in  all  circumstances,  especially  from  those  not  privy  to  recent  test  results  and  the  theor etical  discussion  that  fo llo ws.  Pr ofe ssor  Richard Goldstone  has  over  the  year s  taken  a  studied  look  at  some  basic  assumptions  per  anchoring  mechanics.  In  the  following  par aphr ased  ab stract,  he  presents  a  theoretical  an alysis  (which  testing  later  confirmed)  from  which  the  cordel ette  may  never  recover  it's  reputation  for  equal izat ion.  He  wrote:  15 2  CLIMBING  ANC HOR S  \nIm agine  three  pr imary  placemen ts  in  a  vertical  crack  con nected  and  \"equali zed\"  by a  cordele tte. In  this com­ mon  setup,  prov iding  the  three  arms  of  the  cordele tte  are  equally  tensioned,  many  cl im bers  as sume  that  any  loading  is  dis tributed  equally  between  the  three  plac e­ ments.  Ho wever,  this  as sump tion  is  not  true  in  general  and  may  not  even  be  appr oximately  true  in  simple  cases.  Consider  the mecha­ nism  by  which  the  cordele tte  transm its  forces  to  the  anchor  poin ts.  When the  power  point  is  loaded,  the  arms  of  the  cordele tte  stretch  a  little and  the  power  point  lowers relative  to  the  amoun t  of  stretc h.  The tension  in  each  cordele tte  arm  is  propor ­ tional  to  the  relative  stretch  of  the  arms,  and  the  relative  stretch  of  dif ­ ferent  arms  will,  in  gen­ eral,  be  di ff erent.  To  pic ture  this  in  1  fO OT  (55%  of  l.OI\\I))  Usmg a  c.ord �lette  to  conntlct  anc hors m a  vertical  ct  ack  results  in  an  anchor  that  does  not  tome  close  to  truly  equaflztng  the  forces  action,  return  to  our  simple  and  quite  preva lent  case  of  three  primar y  placem ents  in a  verti cal  line.  Suppose  that  ther e  is  1  foot from  the  power  point  to  the  lo west  anchor ,  and  that  each  of  the two  higher  anchor s  is  1  foot  above  its  pr ed ecessor.  This  means  that  the  arms  from  BE LA Y  ANC HOR S  15 3  \nthe  power  point  to  the  anchor s  are  1,  2  and  3  feet  respective ly.  When  loaded,  the power  point  experien ces  a  downward  displa cement  of  e  feet  (e  will  typ ically  be  a  sm all  frac tion).  The  relative  displa cem ents  are  thus e,  e/2,  and  e/3,  which  means  the  tension  in the  2-foot  arm  is  half  the  tension  in  the  1- foot  arm,  and  the  tension  in  the  3-foot  arm  is one­ third  the  tension  in  the  1- foot  arm.  Put  ano ther  way,  the  lo west  place­ me nt  takes  about  55  per cent  of  the  load,  the  middle  placement  takes  ab out 27  percent  of  the  load, and  the  top  placement  takes  about  18  per cent  of  the  load.  Obviously  this  contr adic ts  conventional  wisdom  about  so-ca lled  anchor  equal izati on,  which  holds  that  each  anchor  takes  on e-th ird  of  the  load.  To  summar ize,  Professor  Gold stone  is  pointing  out that  when  the  arms  of  the  cordele tte  are  of  di ffe rent  leng th,  equal ization is  compromised  by  stretch  in  the  arms,  with  the  arm  that  stretches  least  in  this  case  bearing  better  than  half  (55  per ­ cent)  of  the  load.  When  tested,  the  cordele tte  pr oved  to  equali ze  less  proficiently  than  even  Profess or  Golds tone  surmised,  which  is  why  the  cordele tte  can  no  longer  be  re commended  for  its  equal ization  pr oper ties  when  the  arms  are  of  unequal  length.  Off -Axis  Load ing  on  Cordelettes  So far  our  examples  assume  that  loading will  come  from  dir ectly  below  the  power  point,  which  gives  the  cordele tte  its  best  chance  of  equalizing  the  load  evenly  between  the  arms.  What  happens,  then,  with  load  angle  changes,  when  the  dir ec­ tion  of  pull  comes  from 5  or  1 0  degrees  off  the  vertical  axis? To  visualize  the  vec­ tor s  in volved,  consider  this  paraphrased  explanation  of  Dr .  D.  F.  Merchant,  from  his  exce llen t  cave  rescue  treatise,  Lif e  on  a  Line.  Whene ver  you  combine  two  anchor s  to  a  single  power  point  (as  you do  with  a  cordele tte)  there  will  be  an  angle between  the m.  The  smaller  this  angle,  the  smaller  the  load  on  each  anchor  when  a  dir ect  down­ load  is  appl ied  to  the  power  point.  If  your  load  pulis  outside  the  angle  of  yo ur  an chors,  at  least  one  conn ection  (arm  of  the  cordele tte)  will  be  slack,  bearing  li ttle  to  no  load,  with  the  ot her  conn ection  taut  to  the  load-bearing  placement.  If  your  load  comes from  a  fixed  dir ection,  min ­ imi zing  the  angle  between your  anchor s  is  the  main  aim.  If  you  need  a  range  of  motion, then  making  sur e your  anchor s stay  loaded  is  a  com­ promise against  mini mizing  the  angles.  This  und erscor es  the  fact  that with  the  cordel ette,  ther e  is  only  one  load  angle  where  force  is  dis tributed-in  varying  per centages -to  the  anchor  pieces.

In  The  Mount aineering  Handbook,  Cra ig  Connally  gives  a  simple  num erical  ex am ple:  \"Consider  a  two -placement  setup where the  legs  join  at  a  30-degree  angle.  If the  load  is  off  the  precise  balancing  dir ection by  10  degrees, one  anchor  wi ll  take  three  times  the  force of  the  other.\"  If  this  off -axis  load  exceeds  the  max load  of  each  primar y  protec tion  poin t,  the  pieces  will  fa il  in  succession -t he  ghastly  cascade  fa ilur e-as  the  force  shock  loads  from  one arm  to  the  next.  If the  off -axis  loading  does  not  exceed  the  max  strength  of  the  primar y  protection  point s,  redunda ncy  here  appl ies  only  as  a  backup  since  the  load  will  be  held  by  one  piece,  not the  two  or  thr ee  for  which  the  cordele tte  was  rigged  in the  fi rst  place.  (This  is not  meant  to  di scount  the  imp ortance  of  redunda nc y,  which  would  obviously  be  critical if  the  primar y  load-bearing  piece  were to  fa il .)  This  brings  us  back  to the  matter  of  stretch  in  the  arms of  the  cordele tte.  Spe cifical ly,  can  the  stretch  of  the  arms provide some  off -axis  load  shari ng?

So  far  we've  see  that  the  random  changes  in  the  cordel ette's  arm length may  well  result  in  li mited  ini tial  loading  on  at least one  primar y  placement  as the  anchor  matrix  is  loaded  and  the  stre tching  process  begins.  If  hi gh-t ensile  cord  (an  almo st  static  material)  is  used,  then  it is  poss ible  that  at  least  one  anchor  will  never  be  loaded  unle ss  ther e  is  a  fa ilur e  in  the  others.  This  means  that  Pr ofess or  Gol dstone's  example  (three  pl acemen ts  in  a  vertical  crack),  where  the  long  arm  of  a  cordele tte  absor bs  18  percent  of  the  load,  could  be  a  hig h  estimate.  \"In  fact,\"  writes  Goldstone,  \"my  suspicion  is  that  for  many  anchor s  with  three or more  piec es  in  any  configurat ion,  it  is  quite  possible  that  nearly  all  the  load will  be  impar ted  to  a  single  anc hor ,  even  if  the  load  comes  from  the  expec ted  dir ecti on.\"  The  fact  is  that  any  static  equal ization  setup  is  mor e  rea listically  an  ex ample  of  redundanc y  than  an  exam ple  of  equalization.  We  should  alw ays  keep that in  mind  when  we're  building  an anchor  with  a  cordele tte.  Other  valuable  fe edback  comes  from Jim  Ewi ng,  the  quali ty  control  manager  for  Sterl ing  Ropes,  who  noted  dur ing  testing  that  low-stretch  hig h-t ensile  cord  al ways  weighted  one  leg  first,  which  fa iled, then  the  next  leg,  which  fa il ed,  then  fi nall y  the  last leg, which  fa iled.  Bottom  line:  1.  A no-ext ension  anchor  (inc luding  the  cordel ette)  is  a  distributed  anchor ,  not  an  equali zed  one,  and  it  is  possible  that  at  least  one  of  the  anchor  pieces  will  expe­ rience  li ttle  or  no load  (unless  other s  fa il ).  2.  The  abili ty to  di strib ute  forces  to  all  anchor s  is  in creased  by  the  use  of  stret chier  materi al,  a  strong  endorsement  for  using  a  7mm  nylon  {nylon)  for  any  rigging  system.  Point  2  is  co mm only  trotte d  out  by  those  rec omm ending  the  cordel ette  for  all  anchor ing  setups.  They  claim  that  cord  stretch  provides  off -axis  load  sharing,  and  it  mig ht  somewhat,  but  the  que stion  becomes  this:  What  ava ilable  material  provides  the  ratio  of  stretch  best su ited  to  prom ote  load  sharing  on  a  sh ock-loaded  cordele tte?  An  answer  comes  again  from  Jim  Ewing  at  Sterl ing  Ropes,  who  tested  two  cordel ette  setups  (hand  tied),  one with  hi gh-t ensile  cord,  the other  with  lo w­ tech  nylon  (nylon) .  In  these  tests  the  nylon  al ways  wo n.  The  stretchy  nylon  not  only  won,  it  provided  a  much  more  dy namic  system,  something  mostly  lost on  a  cordele tte  rigged with  compar atively  static  hig h-t ensile  cord.

To most  every  trad  climb er's  relie f,  the  sliding  X  appar ently  resolved  two  lo ng-st anding  concerns:  (1 )  how  to  achie ve  maxi mum  equal ization  between  two  primar y  pi eces  of  protecti on,  and  (2)  how  to  safeguard  against  changes  in the  dir ection  of  loadi ng.  Functionally  effe ctive  within  a  wide  axis,  the  sliding  X  can  be  loaded  from  various  dir ections,  and  the  \"X\"  will  dynami­ cally  sh ift  to  help  distribute  the  force  between  two  pieces.  Rigging  th e  Sliding  X  The  sliding  X  is  simple  to  construct,  but  a  proper  twist  in the  sliding  X  sling  is  essenti al.  When  you  bungle  twis ting  the  X  into  the  sli ng, the  sliding  X  is  tota ll y  use­ less  if  one  placement  fails. To  confirm  proper  rigging  after  conn ecting  the  sliding  X  to  the  placemen ts,  simpl y  clip  a  biner  into the  X,  weight  the  placemen ts  and  slide  the  biner  back  and  forth  along the  sling  to  ensur e fl uid  and  stately  functi oning.  The  sliding  X  pr ovi des  true  automatic  equali zation;  the  drawback  is  that  it  can  allo w  ext ension in  the  system  if  the  slin gs  are  long  and  one  of  the  anchor s  fa ils.  To  mini mize  the  potential  ext ension  in  longer  slings,  tie  an  over hand  \"limi ter\"  knot  in  the  long  leg  of  the  sling ,  just  above  the  tie-in  point.  (Keep  in  mind that  this  lim iter  knot,  while  it  reduces  the pos sibil ity  for  ext ension,  also  by  its  very  nature  limi ts  the  equal izati on  properties  of the  sliding  X.)  Mak e  sur e  the  angle  between the  two  legs  of the  sling  is  not  too  large.  If  the  angle  is  lar ger  than about 45  degrees,  use  a  15 8  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nlonger  sling  to  decrease  the  angle  and  avoid load  multiplica­ tion.  An  angle  of  about  25  degr ees,  as  shown  in  the  slidin g  X  drawing,  works  well.  While  it's  an  ingenious,  simple  and  ef fective  rigging  method,  the  main  concern  is  that  the  sliding  X  violat es  the  No  Ext ension  criteria  of  SRENE.  Put  simp ly,  the  sliding  X  is  used  to  conne ct  two  pr imar y  placemen ts.  If  one  of  the  two  pri­ mary  anch ors  should  blow  when  loaded,  the  force would  \"extend\"  or  dr op  onto the  re maining  place­ ment  equid istant  to  the  slack  in  the  sl ing.  The  concern  is  that  the  force  dumping  onto  the  second  pi ece  mig ht  possibly produce  cascade  zippering  of the  remain­ ing  pi eces  of  the  anchor .  The  pos­ sibi lity  of this has  alw ays  re ma ined  a  black  mark  against  the  sli ding  X,  but Craig  Connally  (a long  with  recent testing)  lar gely  dispr oved  the  prev aili ng  paranoia  about  the  minimal  ex tension  (with  the  limi ter  knots)  pos sibili ­ ties  with  the  sliding  X.  Basically  Connally  explains  that  true  shock  loading  cannot  occu r.  Mi rr oring  recent  tes ting  done  by  Duane  Raleigh  at  Rock  &  Ice  magazine,  he  provides  the  ex ample  of  a  climber  who  clips  to  an  anc hor  with  a  Sp ectra  dais y  chain,  climb s a  few  feet  past  the  anchor ,  then  falls.

But in the case  of  moder ate  extension  fo und  in the  fa iled  arm  of  a  sliding  X  anchor ,  the  aforementi oned  shock  loadin g  does  not occur  if  ther e's  dynamic  rope in  the  syste m.

Unlik ely ,  since that amoun ts  to  a  fa ll  factor  0.1 ,  which  is  less  than  the  average  of  around  0.3  for  most  climb ing  fa lls.  Granted,  you  avoid  building  anchor s  that  cou ld  result  in  really  long  ex tension,  but  there's  li ttle  cause  to  fear  ordinary  setups.

To  mimm1ze  potenti al  ext ension  in  longer  equ;;lizmg  s:ings,  t1e  an  over hand  hm1ter  knot  in  the  long  leg  of  the  sling,  just  above  the  t1e-m  p01nt.  To  avoid  load  multiplication,  keep  the  angle  bet:w een  the  two legs  awund  25  degrees  (or  less) .  If  the  angle  1s  larger  than  about  45  degrees,  use  a  longer  sling  to  decrease  the  angle .  Sliding X:  Normal  Usage  Let's  look  closely  at  how  the  sliding  X  is  normally  engaged  and  dr aw  some  rules  of  thumb  for  gener al  usage.  With solid,  two-b olt  anchor s  on  mul ti  pitch  spor t  climb s  (where  the  issue  of  exte nsion  is  dim inished  and  the scale tips  toward  equal ization  or  redundanc y),  setup  is  quick  and easy.  Plus,  the  sliding  X  saves having  to  leave  two  draws  at  the  anch or.  And  for  anchor s  placed in  non-hor izontal  orientations -say,  two  cams  in  a  slanting  crack -the  sliding  X  can  conn ect  the  pair  so  they  are  largely  equalized  while  provi ding  vastly  mor e  mul tidir ect ional  capa cities  than  if  you  were  to  tie  the  same two  pieces  together  with  either  a  cordel ette  or with knots  tensioned  in  a  sli ng.  In  fact,  whenever  you  wish  to  dynamically  dis tribute  the  load  between two  pieces,  the  sliding  X  is  both  effe ctive  and  the  best-known  method.  16 0  CLIM BIN G  ANCHORS  \nA  :ilidfng  X  conn ecting  two  bolt� .

The  lower  sling  ha�  been  dou­ bled  tCI  adJust  the  location  of  the  power  pomt  The  sliding  X  is also  effe ctive  for  equalizing  pieces  on  lead,  especially  when  doubling  up  small  or  sketchy  nu ts,  when  it  is  desir able  to  get  load  distribution  over  both  pieces.  Likewise  when  arranging  pr otection  before  a  traverse,  or  after  a  tra­ verse,  when the  route  goes  abruptly  up,  the  sliding  X  is  a  blessing,  equalizing  mar­ ginal  pieces  so  they  reinf orce  each  other  across  a  mu lt idir ecti onal  ra nge.  The  pos sibili ty of  exten sion  (small with  limi ter  knots)  her e  is  eclipsed  for  ease of  setup  when  out  on  the  sharp  end.  A  leader  will  also find the  sliding  X  useful  as  a  power  poin t  on  mul tipitch  routes.  For  in sta nce,  at  the  end  of  a  lead,  if  you  gain  a  ledge  and  ne e d  to  move  around,  the  sliding  X  will  alw ays  keep tension  on  the  anchor  and  reta in  equali zat ion.  Occasionally  the  \"X\"  in  the  configuration  can  bind  on  itself  (the  so-ca lled  \"clutch  ef fect\" ).  A  simple  and  test-proven  solution  is  to  rig  the  power  point  with  one  or  two  BE LA Y  AN CHORS  16 1  \nHer e we have a  pre- equal ized  anchor .  rnt!anm:I  no  se lf-e quali zing  slidmg  X  IS  used .

With  poor  (i.e.,  weak)  plac ements,  the  concern  is  that  a  fa ll  could  blo w  out  the  anchor  poin t, so  equal ization  becomes  a  prio rity.  The  aim  is  to  reduce  the  ini tial  loading  on  the  stacked  (doubled up), weak  placem ents  by  di stributing the load  as  equally  as  possible  over both pieces.  Here,  exten sion  is  of  less  concern  than  maxi­ miz ing  the  potential  holdin g  strength  of  the  anchor point  to  the  extent  that  it  will  actually  hold.  Clea rly  two  sketchy  placem ents  are  better  than  one.  And  since  the  sliding  X  is the  best  thing  going  for equalizing  two  place ment s- especially  with  the  use of  lim iter kn ots-it  remains  for  many  the  strategy of  choice  when  rigging  together  stacked,  sketchy  placemen ts.

When  the  placem ents  are  medi ocre  to  poor ,  many  will  stati cally  equali ze  using  ove rhand  knots  on  a  sling , a  method that  testing has  shown  to  yield  li ttle-if  any - equal ization  between  pieces.

For  those  less  concerned  about  ext ension,  it's  better  to  dynamically  equalize  the load on the  gear  (using  the  sliding  X)  in  an  effo rt  to  pr event  failur e  than  to  anticipa te  fa il ure  and  mi tiga te  the  conse­ quence  of  ext ensi on.  Using  limi ter  knots to  minimi ze  ex tension  in  a  sliding  X  is  a  solution  that  could  possibly  appease  both  camps,  but  as  yet,  it  has  not.  Ch anges  in  th e  Direction  of  Pull  Although  this  was  covered  in  earlier  chap ters,  it's worth  repeating:  Every  clim ber  having  to hand  build  a  belay  anchor  on  a  route  that  traverses  left  or  right  dir ectly  off the belay  faces  a  particula rly  ch al lenging  situation.  Pitons,  fixed  pin s  and (to  a  lesser  degree)  SLCDs  are  all  mul tidir ec ti onal,  but every thing  else  is  unidir ecti onal,  so  any  mul ti dir ectional  capacities  must  be  pr ovi ded  by  the rigging.  Consider ,  for  ex amp le,  a  belay  anchor  where  the  leader  traverses  1 0  feet  right,  plac es  a  nut  and  fa lls.  Pro viding  the  pr otection  holds, the  dir ection  of pull will  come  BE LA Y  ANCH ORS  16 5  \ndir ectly from  the  right.  If  the  pr otection  fa il s,  or  if  the  leader  fa lls  before  placing  the  ini tial  pr o,  the  dir ection  of  pull will  describe  an  arc.  Much  of  the  load  comes  when  the  leade r's  str aigh t-down  fall  begins  to  be  pulled  into  the  arc,  and  it  continues  until  he  is  in  the  fa ll line.  Her e  the  challe nge  is  to  build  an anchor  that  will  safeguard  dead  lateral  pull ,  the  arc  of  the  swing  and  the  str aight  down  load ing  once  the  lead er's  full  weight  slams  onto  the  end  of  the  rope.  A st atically  equalized  anchor  can  only cover this  90-d egree  arc  at  various  poin ts.  At  best  the  load  will  fa ll  variously  onto  individual  placem ents  as the  climber  swings  through  the arc.  A  dynamically  equali zed  anchor  lik e  the  sliding  X- alo ne,  or  as  a  component  within  a  larger  anchor  matrix -can  cover  the  entir e  arc  insofar as the  X  slides  as  the  vectors  change.  THE  EQU ALETTE  The  equale tte  was  born  out  of  lab  tests  conduc ted  by  Jim  Ew ing  at  Ste rling  Ropes.  The  system  was  rigorously  field  tested  by  profess ional  guides  Bob  Gaines,  To m  Cecil  and  others,  who reported  very  favor able  results.  While  only  time  can  render  the  verdict  on  a  rigging  syste m,  the  equale tte  and  quad  (ex plained  shor tly)  per­ formed  wel l  in  both the  lab  tests  and in  the  field,  and  they  are  worth  consider ation  as  primar y  rigging  tools.  16 6  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  This  dllse  up  of  an  equal ette  p0wer  point  (tied  usmg  slinRs  rather  than  cord)  clearl\\7  shows  how  tu  ng  two  locking  biner s  through  thE\" :  str ands  between  th E:'  limi ter  kno ts  The  bel ayer  1s  tied  into  the  power  point  With  a  fig­ ure  eight  knot  This  set  up  will  re main  equali zed  if  the  load  swings  right  or  left,  but  if  one  anchc.r  should  fall,  the  limi ter  knots  will  mm1mi ze  e)(tension  1n  the  syo;tem .  \nThree-ptece  anchor  rig<;Jed  with  an  equale tte .

After  the  cord  is con­ nected  with  a  double  fisherman's  knot,  the  loop  is then  formed  into  a U  shape.  At  the  bottom  of  the  U,  two  limi ter  knots  are  tied  appr oximately  10  inches  apar t,  with  the  fisherman's  knot  situated just  above  one  of  the  li miter  kno ts. This keeps the  fisherman' s  knot  clear  of  the  two-stra nd  arms  of  the  equale tte  that  are  used  to  tie  off  primar y  placements.  For  speed  and efficiency  the  lim iter  knots  are  best  le ft  tied  in to  the  sling  between  usage.  BE LAY  ANCHOR S  16 7  \nFour -ptece  eq•Jal ette  rig .

When  rigging,  keep  the  power  point  centered  at  the bottom by  clip­ ping  the  lo west  placement first then working  up  the  place ments  from  there.  To  start, hold  the  right -ha nd  limi ter  knot  2  to  6  inches  below  your  lowest  piece.

Adjust the  str ands  so  your  knots  end  up  evenly  tensioned  (cl ove  hitches  are  very  helpful  there,  if  not  re quir ed).  For  a  two -placement  setup,  conn ect  each  arm  of  the  equale tte  to  the  place­ ments  via  the  loops  in the  cord,  clo ve  hi tches  or  overh and  knots on  a  bight.  For  three  placemen ts,  one  arm  will  accommoda te  two  placeme nts  (usually  with  clove  hitches  tied  into  individual  stra nds  of  the  arms),  and  the other  arm  will  conn ect  to  one  plac ement  (via the  loop  in the  cord,  a  cl ove  hitch  or  overh and  on  a  bight).  For  conn ecting  four  plac ements,  each  strand  (fo ur  total)  of  the two  arms  will  conn ect  the  placem ents  via the  loop  in the  cord,  clove  hi tches. Be  sur e  the  load-bearing  str ands alig n  with  the  spine  of  the  bin er.  The  equal ette  can  also be  rigged  using  a  double -leng th  sling ,  though  you'll  find  the  7mm  cordel ette  easier  and mor e  versat ile  to  work  with,  especially  when  tying  clove  hi tches.  Plus  you  have  the  added  ben efit  of  the  stretch  in  the  nylon  cord  to  reduce peak  loading  on  the  anchor  syste m.  Te sts  show  that the  equale tte  allo ws  nearly  per fect  equali zation  between  the  two  arms,  and  it  allo ws  a  ratio  of  equali zati on  between  both  str ands  on  each  arm.  While  it is  impossible  (in  a  practical  sense)  to  achie ve per fect  equali zation  between  all  four  plac ements,  the  equale tte  achie ves  a  degree  of  equal izatio n-a long  with  solid  redunda ncy  and very  inconsequential  ext ensio n-to  a  higher  degr ee  than  any  system  tested.  BE LAY  ANCH ORS  16 9  \nBecause  the  power  point  biner s can  slip  side  to  side  on  the  str ands  between  the  li miter  knots,  the  system,  when  weighted,  will  dynamically  equalize  to  accom­ modate  a  limi ted  degree  of  off -axis  loading.  In  those  rare  cases  wher e  ho rizontal  forces  can  imp act  the  bel ay,  oppositional  anchor s  are  needed.  As  with  any new rigging  system,  it  takes  a  few  times  working  through  a  vari ety  of  anchor s  before  you  can rig the  equale tte  qu ickly  and  effi cie ntly.  The  ha rdest  par t  of the  system  is  getti ng  used  to  feath ering  the  knots to  achie ve  equal  tension  in the  arms  and/or  str ands.  But this  is  mastered  qui ckly,  making  the  equal ette  as  fast  to  rig  as the  cordele tte.  And  because  you  don't  use  as  many  knots  with  the  equale tte,  breaking  down  the  system  is  much  faster  than  breaking  down a  cordel ette.  Ad vantages  of  th e  Equalette  •  It  provides  vastly  superior  equal izati on  over the  cordele tte.  •  If  you  pull  considerably  off -axis  on  an  equale tte,  two  arms  remain  equalized.

Limitat ions  of  the  Equalette  No  rigging  method  is  without  its  lim itations,  and  one  size,  or  one  syste m,  does  not  fit  all  circums tances.  In itial  experiences  suggest that  the  equale tte  is  quite  versati le  and  user  friend ly,  but  several  things  should  be  kept  in  mind. While  the  two  arms  of  the  equal ette  achie ve  a  remark able  degree  of  equal izat ion,  the  equal ization  between  the  ind ividual  str ands  is  less  than  the  al most  per fect  equali zation  between the  arms  when  the  system  is  rigged  to  three  or  four  plac ements.  Also,  too  many  cl ove  hitches  tied  into  small-dia meter  cord  can  twist  the  rope,  so  con­ sider  using  a  combination  of  knots  when  rigging  three  or mor e  pl acem ents.  The Quad  The  quad  is  simply  a  doubled equal ette,  resulting  in  a fou r-stra nd  \"super  slin g\"  that  has  pr oved  peer less  for  use  when  belaying and/or top  roping  from  two  horizontally  oriented  (sid e-by-s ide )  bolts.  The  quad  is  a  specia lty  item  that  has  limi ted  pr actical  use,  but for  those  who  toprope  or  belay  off  bolts,  having  a  quad  pr e-rigged  on  a  sling  means  you  have  a  virtually  ind estruc tible,  ready -made rigging  system  that  almo st  pe rfectly  equal izes  two  placeme nts  and  is  rigged  as  quickly  as  you  can  clip  off  four  bin ers.  The  quad  is  best  rigged with 5.5mm  hig h-t ensile  cord  (for  durabi lity  and  com­ pactness ).  Fir st,  form  a  loop by  connec ting  a  20-foot  piece  of  hig h-t ensile  cord  with  a  triple  fishe rman's  knot.  Double  that  loop  and  form  the  doubled  loop  into  a  U.

Clip  off  the  dou­ bled  ends  of  each  arm  to  each  bolt  respectively ,  and  arrange  the  power  point  via  two  lo cker s  clip ped  in to  two  or  three  str ands  between  the  li miter  knots.  The quad  is  mega-strong  and  durable,  and  it  provides  great  equali zation,  acc ommoda tes  some  off-a xis  loading  and  is  alm ost  instantaneous  to  rig.

COMPOSITE  ANCHORS:  CORDELEnE,  SLIDING  X  AND  EQUALETTE  Before  the  Sterling  Ropes  tests  (described  later  in  this  chap ter),  which  redefi ned  our use  of  the  tr aditional  cord ele tte  rigging  system,  many clim bers  belie ved  that  the  sliding  X  was best  consid ered  as  a  component  and  that  the  cordele tte  was  the  Whole Ball  Game.  In  any  event,  because  it  is  fast and  req uir es  nothing  beyond  a  sling , the  slidin g X  is  the  most  eff icient  and  flexible  method  of  com binin g  two  pri­ mary  placemen ts  to  a  cordele tte,  or  better yet,  an  equale tte.  17 2  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nIn the  traver sing  scenario  mentioned  ea rlier , a  cordele tte  or  knotted  sling s  wou ld  be  orien ted for  a  vertical/down­ ward  pull.  As  has  been shown,  ho rizon­ tal  loading  wo uld  variously  fa ll  on  single  placemen ts,  intr oducing  greater  load­ ing /cascade  fa ilur e  potent ial.  In  the  past  it  was  here  that  we  mig ht  have  com­ bined  a  sliding  X  with  a  cordele tte  so  that  if  the  leader  fe ll  from  abo ve  the  belay  with  no  gear  in,  the whole  anchor  was  equali zed  fo r a  downward  pull,  but  if  the  leader  fell  on  the  traverse,  the  two  pieces  conn ected  by  the  sliding  X  would  shar e  the  load.  Now  it  seems  that we  have even  mor e  options,  including  an  equale tte,  or an  equale tte  combined  with  a  sliding  X,  the  latter  configur ation  shorn  up  with  one or  more  oppo sition- a  is  set for  upward  forces,  thus  forming  a  super  mul tidir ectional  anchor . Wh atever  system or  combination  you  choose,  safeg uarding  the  fu ll  range  of  the  arc  is  the  goal.  Another  common  com po sit e-a nchor  situation  occur s  when  a  cordele tte  or  Multi-pi tch  anchor  With  c.orclele tte  and  slidmg  X  combo  While  th1s  setup­ and  ones  hke  1t-have been  a  mains tay  for  manv  years.  mcor poratmg  new  techr o1ques  such  as  �he  equa lette  will  allo w  cli mbers  to  ach1 eve  even  greater  equ<!l i zation .  equa let te  isn't  long  enough  to  equali ze  thr ee  pieces  and  remain  pointed  in  the  anticipa ted  dir ection  of  pull.  To  fix  this,  simp ly  equal ize  two  of  the  pi eces with  a  sliding  X,  then  rig  this  with  the  cordele tte  or  equale tte  to  the  third  piece.  In this  si t­ uation  it  makes  sense  to  use  an  equale tte  in  place  of  a  cordele tte  to  ach ieve  supe- rior  equali zati on.  WHAT'S  BEST  FOR  BEGIN NERS?  What,  by  and  lar ge,  is  the  most  appr opri ate  system  for  begin ner s?  Every  in structor  knows  that  beginn ers  are  sur e  to  place  sketchy  gear  (pr imar y  placem ents)  and  mis­ judg e  the  dir ection  of  pull.  For  this  reason  we  suggest  a  se lf-eq uali zing  system  that  will  adapt  to  changes  in load  dir ection  and  that  will  exploit  the  coll ective  stre ng th  of  less than  textb ook  plac ements.  BELA Y  ANCH ORS  17 3  \nSRENE  Anchor s  Solid  Redunda nt  Equal ized  No  extension  Guide  To m  Cecil says,  \"It  is  mor e  pr otective  to  teach  se lf- equali zation  to  beginners.  Using  self - equal ization  as  a  strategy  is  lik e  using  tr aining  wheels  on  a  bike.  They  allo w  the  beginner  to  lean  in any  dir ection  and  still  be  held.  Over  time  they  learn  to  anticipate  these  forces .\"  Bob  Gaines,  co-a uthor  and  owner  of  Vertical  Adven­ tures  guide  service,  sees it  this  way:  \"The  key  in teach- ing novices  is  to  stress  the  absolu te  imp ortance  of  av oiding  factor  2  fa ll  situations.  They  must  be  taught  to  recognize  the  forces  and  place  pro  (the  Jesus  Nut) soon  and  often  abo ve  a  bel ay.  This  help s  ensur e  that the  peak  forces  that  novices  encounter  will  occur  at  the  hig hest  piece  of  pro,  not  at the  anchor .  In  most  situations,  when  bel ayers  are  cat ching  a  leader  fa ll,  it  is  a  good  thing  if  the  force  gener ated  by  the  fa lling  leader  is  great  enough  to  pull  the  bela yer  sligh tly  upward,  as the  coun terwe ight  effe ct  greatly  reduces  the  force  on  the  piece  the  leader  has  fa llen  on.  Th erefore,  the best  belay  strategy  is to  be  anchored  against  the  upward  pull  with  a  bit  of  slack  in  the  system,  which  provides  some  count erbalance  shoc k- absor bing,  but  not  so  much  so  that  the  be/oyer  is  pumm eled  into  the  wall  or  extruded  through  the  Jesus  Nut.  \"As  far  as  toprope  setups  go,  the  dir ection  of  pull  is  basically  stra ight  down­ easy  to  ju dge  even  by  the  novice.  The  biggest  and  most  common  mis take  I  see  with  novice  rigger s  (aside  fro m  poor  primar y  placeme nts)  is  usually  major  exten­ sion  potential  and lack  of  redunda ncy.\"  UPWARD  OPPO SITIONAL  ANCHORS  As  shown  in  various  pho tos,  for  an  anchor  to  susta in  upward  loading,  we  often  place  a  nut or  cam  set for  an  upward  pull,  below  and  in  opposi tion  to  the  other  pri­ mary  placem ents  in  the  anchor  matrix.  While  upward  forces  at  a  belay  are  gener ­ all y  small  compar ed  to  downward forces, I've  repeatedly  seen this  oper a  play  out  in the gym: A  bela yer  is  grossly  outweighed  by  some  lug  climbing  on  a  toprope.  From  neglect  or  sloth  the  svelte  belayer  has  for egone  a  ground  anchor .  Jumbo  pitches  off  and  the  belayer is  dir ectly  wrenched  5  to  20  feet  into  the  air .  I'v e  wit­ nessed  bela yers  hoisted  ali  the  way  to  the  top  anchor ,  30  feet  up.  Jumbo,  who  is  now  on  the  ground, acts  as  a  cou nter we ig ht/a nchor ,  and  the  belayer  returns  to  the  deck  by  ra ppelling  down  the  rope  via  th eir  belay  device,  through  which the  rope  runs.  This  scenario  is  part icular  to  the  gym,  where  the  routes  are  vertical  to  over­ hanging  and  the  top  rope  usually  runs  over  a  chubby  pipe  on the top  of  the  route.  On  a  cl iff  the  rope  runs  through  carabiners,  at  ra dicall y  tighter  angles  that  won't  al low  such  a  meteoric  hois t  as  found  in  the  gym fiasco.  Ne verth eless,  this  17 4  CLIMBING  ANC HOR S  \nextrava gant  hoisting  of  the  belayer  of ten  took  pl ace  during  drop  tests  conduc ted  by  the  Sie rra  Club  and  other outfits  during  the  19 60s and early  19 70s.  In  the  Sier ra  Club  ver sion,  one  end  of  some  goldlin e  rope  was  atta ched  to  a  buck et  of  concr ete  weighing  roughly  12 0  pounds.  The  ro pe  ra n up an  over hanging  wall to  an  anchor  on  top-or  was  conn ected to  a  cross-beam  in  a  gy mnasium,  as  the  case may have  been -t hen  back  down to  a  bela yer  on the  gr ound.  By  means  of  another  line,  the  bu cket  was  heaved  1 0  to  20  feet  into  the  air -acco rd ing  to the  sadis tic  leanings  of  the  in structor -th en  cut  loose,  leaving  the  bela yer  to  ar rest  the  1  0-to 20-foot  \"f all\"  via  a  hip  bel ay.  Mor e  than  one  corn-fed  male  was  launched  as if  shot  from  a  catapult,  and  it  was even  mone y  that  a  wispy  female  could  get  extruded  half way  through  the  anchor  biner .  Such  was  the  exa min ation  to  become  a  certified  rock  climber  in  year s  past.  The  tub by/svelte  toprope  hoist  job  and  the  antique  drop  test  are  goof ball  exam­ ples  but  nonetheless  demon strate  the  power  of  upward forces,  and  the  need  to  safeguard  against  them  if  and  when  they  are  sig nificant  factors.  The  question  is:  What are  the  circumstances  in  which  up ward forces  are  great  enough  to  warrant  oppositional  placemen ts  in  the belay  anchor ?  Let's  place  our selves  back  on  the  rock  and  see  what  qu estions  arise.  Consider  a  lea der  cli mbing  abo ve  a  hanging  bel ay.  If  she  fa lls  off  and  is  ar rested  by the  Jesus  Nut,  for  ins tance,  or  pro  she  has  placed  higher , the  belayer  will  be  pulled  upward,  or  dir ectly  toward the first  piece  of  pr otection  off  the  bel ay- which  is  generally  upward  sinc e  most  climbs  go  up.  But  what  is the  actual  power  of  this  upward  force  on  a  bel ayer?  Most  of  us  have held  leader  falls  that  have  jerked  us  skyward  hard and  fast,  but  even  on  steep  sport  routes,  if the belayer and  the  leader  weigh  roughly  the  same,  when have  you  ever  seen  a  bel ayer,  following  a  leader  fa ll,  left  in  midair , stret ched  taut  against  an  anchor  str aining  ag ains t the  upward  force?

In  fact  one  of  the  ongoing  debates  in  the  climbing  communi ty  is  whether  or  not  upward-oppositional  pl acem ents  are  necessar y  at  all.

For this  to  ever  hap pen,  the  bela y  anchor  wo uld  have  to  be  set  in  vertical  cracks  and  consist  of  nuts  and,  less  lik e ly,  cams-pro  that  might  con­ ceivably  be  pluck ed  clean  if the  bela yer  were  yanked  a  suf f icient  dis­ tance  above  the  anch or .

We  know that  during  a  leader  fa ll  (held  by pro  abo ve  the  belay),  sl ight  lif t  of  the  bel ayer's  body and flex  and  give  in  the  system  act  as  peak  force  reducer s,  absorb­ ing much  of  the  fall's  kinetic  ener gy  before  the  anc hor  is  ever  loaded.  If  nothing  else,  rope  sli p/stretch  will  lik ely  preclude  a  meteoric  hoist,  even  when  little  rope is  out.  But  that 's  with  a  bela yer  who  weighs  ro ughly  the  same  as  the  leader .  Get  a  leader  who  weighs  twice  as  much  as  the  bel ayer,  and  the  lif t factor  becomes  sign if­ icant  no  mat ter  the  angle.  Here  the  peak  force  reduction  enjoyed  by  the  body  of  a  lar ge  climber  is  null  and  void.  And  so  is the  main  argument  against  setti ng  nu ts  for  an  upward  pull:  No matter  the  fa ll  scenario,  the  belayer  is  not  lik ely  to  be  li fted  far  17 6  CL IMBING  ANCHOR S  \nenough  to  threaten  the  anchor .  My counter  to  this  claim  is  that  I  (21 0  pounds)  once  fell  at  Ta hqu itz  and  pull ed  bel ayer  Lynn  Hill  (1  05  pounds)  10  feet  in to  the  air .  When  Opp ositionals  Are  Required  While  there are  instanc es-p rimarily  on  low-angled  clim bs-that  clim ber s  can  argue  against  setti ng  nu ts  to  safeguard  against  up ward  pull,  there  are  other  instances  wher e  upward  oppositionals  are  compulsor y.  These  include  A)  steep  hanging  bela ys  built from  hand-placed  gear ,  B)  whene ver  you are  belaying  belo w  an  overh ang  and  the  ini tial  protection  off  the  belay  anchor  (J esus  Nut)  is  dir ectly  abo ve  or  even  behind  (such  as  with  a  roof  crack)  the  anchor ,  and  C)  when  a  be  layer  is  sign ificantly  lig hter  than  the  active  climb er.  All  three  of  these  examples  are  where  the  rock  is  near ,  at  or  past  vert ica l,  wher e a  fa lling  climber  will  basically  be  air borne  and where  forces  gener ated  by  a  leader  fa ll  are  great  enough  to  start  replicating  the  mega-hoist  seen in  our  fi rst  two  exampl es-the  toprope  scenario  in  the  gym  and in the  Sie rra  Club  drop  test.  Bottom  line:  Some  li ttle  \"l ift\"  at  the belay  is  usually  a  good  thing,  acting  as  a  coun terwe ight  and  load  limi ter  to  the forces  gener ated  by a  leader  fa lli ng  above.  But  whene ver  the  potential  of  that  lif t  exceeds  a  foot  or  so  (the  A,  B  and  C  in our  examples  abo ve) ,  oppositional  placem ents  should  alw ays  be  incorpor ated  into  the  belay  anchor .

To  answer  the fundamental  questions  raised  in  that  discussion,  we  needed  to  gen erate  some  har d  data.  The  aim  of  tes ting  was  to  determ ine  performance  dif ferences  between  the  slidin g X  and the  cordele tte  when  both  systems  were  subjec ted  to  the  same  dyna mic  load  (as  found  in  a  real  world  fa ll) .  Since  hundr eds  of  thousands  of  clim ber s  literally  hang  their  li ves  off  these  syste ms  on  a  weekly  basis,  such  testing  was  clearly  ind ispensable  to  both  this  manual  and  the  climbing  community  at  lar ge.  On  the  recommendation  of  Kolin  Powick,  qua lity  assurance  manager  at  Black  Diamond,  the  physical  testing  was  conduc ted  by  Jim  Ewing,  research  and  develop­ ment  manager  at  St erling  Ropes.  Ewing  is  both  a  world-class  climb er  and  an  engi­ neer  with  years  of  experience  testing  on Sterling's  UIM  drop towers and  computer  assist  gear ,  and  he  is  widely  considered  the  leading  tester  in  the  Uni ted  States.  The  tests  took  weeks  and  many  late  nights  to  com ple te  (upwards  of  200  drop  tests  were  per fo rmed)  and  went  far  in  answering  many  long -st anding  questions about  riggi ng  sys tems.  Very  much  an  ongoing  team  ef fort,  Ewing's  raw  data  was  worked  up  by  nat iona lly  recognized  statis tical  exper ts  (and  climb ers)  Dr.  Lawrence  Hamil ton  and  Dr .  Calli e  Rennison.  Last ly,  the  tests  led  to  a  di scovery  phase  involving  several  new  rigging  stra tegies  that were  field  tested  and  refi ned  by  profess ional  guides  Bob  Gaines  and  To m  Cecil  and  others.  Te st  Par ame ters  In  order  to  devise  the  most  signi ficant  tests,  we  fi rst  had  to  determine  what  factors  were  most  crucial  to  a  team  buil ding  and  belaying  off  a  real  world  anchor .  This  involv ed  ex amining  the  fo llowing  eleme nts  of  the  anchor  chain.  1)  The  prim ary  pl acements.  Hundr eds  of such  tests  alr eady  exist  on  the  strength of  \"this\"  bolt  and  \"that\"  camming  device.  Further  anal yses  could  te ll  us  li t­ tle  about  the  appl ied  function  of  either  the  sli ding  X  or  the  cordele tte.  2)  The  conn ecting  points.  In  other  words,  the  bin ers  that  connect  the  cor dele tte  and the  slid ing  X  to  both  the  primary  anchor  placem ents  and  the  power  point.  Again,  we  ini tially  belie ved  such  testi ng  wo uld  divulge  little  about  per form­ ance  dif f erences  per  either  rigging  system-a  belief  we  later  revised.  3)  Mater ials.  Because  pr evious  testi ng  indi cated  performance  di fferences  between  old- style  nylon and  hi gh-t ensil e-strength  cord and  webbing  (Dyneema,  Spec tra,  etc.).  we  decided  to  use  a  variety  of  commonl y  used  materials  for  all  testing.  BE LAY  ANCHOR S  18 3  \n4)  Knots.  Te sts  have  shown  the  holding  power  of  hi gh-te nsile  cord  is  reduced  once  it  is  knotted  (less  so in  nylon).  Ho wever  there  is  little  if  any  real world evi­ dence  to  su ggest  that  the  holding  strength  of  a  use-appr opr iate,  properly tied  knot -tied  in  any  materia l-has  ever  caused  anchor  fa ilur e.  Hence  the  issue  of  knots  and  knot  strength  was  ruled out as  being  relevant  to  our  testing.  5)  Exte nsion.  Not  an  issue  with  the  cordel ette.  And  with  limi ter  knots  (alw ays  advised),  the  exte nsion  possibil ities  of  the  sliding  X  are  reduced  to  mer e  inches.  As  Cr aig  Connall y  has  shown,  pro vid ing  ther e  is  flex  and  give  in  the  system-as  there  normall y  is  in  a  real  world  belay  and  a  real  world  leader  fal l-it  seemed  unlik ely  that  ext ension  of  mer e  inches  can  ever  cause the  \"shock  loadi ng\"  we  so  frequently  read  about.  While  the  limi ted  ext ension  (as  found  in  a  sliding  X  with  limi ter  knots)  was  con­ sid ered  a  minor  factor  in  dete rmining  performance  di ffe rences  between  rigging  systems,  we  had  no  lab  data  to  determ ine  the  forces  involved  during this  exten­ sion.  Wrestl ing  with  this  lo ng-st anding  question,  Jim  conduc ted  a  battery  of  tests  that  stro ngly  suggest  shor t  ext ension does  not  cause  any  in crease  in  forces  (load  mul tiplic ation)  beyond  the  initial  load  on  the  system  prior  to  the  fa ilur e  of  one  pri­ mary  anchor  placement.  This  is  a  fasc inating,  involved  and  impor tant  sub ject  that  warrants  further  resear ch.  6)  Redundanc y.  In  terms of  a  belay  anch or,  a red undant anchor  is  di fferent  than  an  anchor  that  is  mer ely  backed  up.  A  redundant  belay  anchor  implies  that  the  forces  gener ated  in  a  leader  fa ll  will  never  fall  on  one  piece  of  gear .  With  a  backed  up  anchor ,  the  force  fa lls  on  a  single  primar y  anchor  placement,  and  if  that  fa ils,  the  force  then falls  on  a  second  placement,  and if  that  fa ils,  the  force  impac ts  a th ir d  placeme nt-the  dreaded  \"cascade\"  anchor  fa ilur e.  To  avoid  this  cascade  scenario  and  to  enjoy  functional  redundancy  in  a  belay  anchor  (to  avoid  loading  on  one piece  of  gear),  impac t  forces  must  be  spread  or  equalized  over  at  least  two  primar y  place­ ments.  To  determine  how  well  any  rigging  system  accomplishes  such  functi onal  redundanc y  would  ther efore  involve the  issue  of  equali zati on.  7)  Equal izati on.  Equal izati on  is  the  very  qual ity  for  which  the  sliding  X  and  the  cor dele tte  wer e  designed,  and  are  emp loyed,  to  achie ve.  After  the  previous  an aly­ sis  it  became  clear  that  the  most  meani ngful  testi ng  wo uld  determine  how well or  how  poor ly the  sliding  X  (dy namically  equal ized  system)  and  the  cordele tte  (stati­ cally  equali zed  system)  del ivered  on  their  promise  of  equalization.  To  cont rast  the  functional  equali zation  of  the  sliding  X  and  the  cordel ette,  we  decided  on the  following  test  parameters:  •  \"Slow  pull,\"  static  loading  tests  have  limit ed  bearing  on  real  world  spor t  and  adventure  climbing.  Only drop  tests,  using  actual  climbing  rope,  could  replic ate  the  dynamic  forces  of  a  real  world  leader  fa ll.  18 4  CLIMBING  ANCHO RS  \n•  A  drop  test  equaling  a  real  world  factor  1  fa ll  wo uld  be  used  during  each  and  every  test.  Factor  1  forces  represent  a  sig nificant  but  ·  not  shattering  fa ll.  Such  forces  would  plainly  illus trate  how  well  both  the  sliding  X  and  the  cordele tte  distributed  the  dynamic  load (in  our  case)  over  two  primar y  place ments  of  an  anchor .  It  is  almo st certa in  that  a greater  or  lesser  dynamic  force  (th an  that  of  a  factor  1  fa ll)  would  not  change  the  actual  load­ Metric  Conver sion  Chart  1  mm  0  039  iriCh  1  em  0.393  Inch  1  dm  3  937  inch  1 m  39.37  mch  3.28  f  et  1  kg  1  kN  2  2046  pounds  220  pounds  sharing  rati os,  and  that from  the  ratios  pr o vided  by  the  factor  1  tests,  we  could  reliably  extr apola te  up  or  down.

This  length of cord was used to  simpli fy  setup.  2.  The  dynamic  load  (\"mass\")  was  dropped  on  1  0.2mm  Sterl ing  Kosmos  lead  rope.  3.  All  drops  =  fall  factor  1  on  O.Sm  of  rope  (sta rting  leng th)  between  figur e  eight  knots.  4.  Mass =  10 0  kg  Summary:  Sim ply  put,  the  first  tests  an swered  the  following  que stion:  If  we  rigged  a  cordele tte  and  a  sliding  X  off  the  same  anchor s  (in  both  verti cal  and  hori­ zontal  configurations)  and sub jected the  anchor s  to  a  contr olled,  dynamic  fall  of  exactly  the  same  leng th  and  force,  what  might  the  test  data  disclose  in  terms  of  how  well  the two  rigging  syste ms  di stributed  the forces  between  the two  anchor  poin ts?  Here  is  what  we  fo und.  These  tests  provided  two  dis tinct  pie ces  of  information  about  the  sliding  X  and  the  cordele tte  rigging  syste ms.  Fir st,  the  results  offe r  the  average  absolu te  \"d iffer­ ence  in  force\"  or  \"d iffe rence  in  load\"  between the  two  legs  of  the  anchor  gener­ ated  due  to  a  factor  1  fa ll.  In  some  cases,  these  di ffe r ences  are  close  to  zero,  mean in g  that  each  leg  of  the  anchor  receives  about  half  of the  force.  In  others,  the  di ff erences  are  quite  hi gh,  sug gesting  that  one leg  is  experiencing  a  dispr opo rtion­ ate  amount  of  the  force  gener ated.  ideally  we  would like  to  see  the  force  di strib­ uted  equally  between  the  two arms  of  the  anchor .  Second,  test  results  ind icate how  consistent  or  inconsis tent  these  measur ed  \"d iffe rences  in loa d/force\"  are  across multiple  tests.  In  some cases,  repeated  meas­ ures  will  produce  very  cons istent  res ults. In  other  cases,  great  variation  in  meas­ ureme nts  of  these  di ff erences  will  be  noted,  suggesting  that  the  di ffe rence  in  load  BE LAY  ANCHORS  18 5  \nHOR IZO NTAL  ANCHOR  SCENARIO -EQUAL  LEGS  DistancE  between  anchor  att achment  po1nts  =  30c  m  :!:  1  em  Length  of  le g s  =  70cm  :1:  1  em  Length  of  IE=gs  0'  70cm  :!:  1  em  Angle  between  legs ·\"\"  24'  Angle between  leg s  �.  24°  VER TICAL  CR ACK  SCEN AR IO-U NEQ UAL LEGS  Dis tance  l:letween  top  and  bottom  anchor  pomts  =  45cm  Length  o!

Repeated  measur ements  of  the dif ference  in  the  forces  gener ated  varied  some­ what  across  multiple  tests.  Contrary  to  conventi onal  wisdom  and  popular  usage,  the  cordele tte,  even  with  equal-leng th  arms,  is  not  a  very  effe ctive  system  to  achie ve  equali zati on.  B.  Sliding  X  equal  length:  Te sting  of  this  anchor  configur ation  sho ws  that  on  average,  the  absolu te  di ffe rence  in  force  transferred  to  each  equal -leng th  arm  due  to  a factor 1  fall  was very  close  to  zero  (i.e.,  about  0.2  kN  di ffe r ence) .  In  other  words,  on  average,  there  is  al most  no  dif ference  in load  measur ed  using  a  sliding  X  equal-leng th  rigging  configuration.  This  configuration  equal izes  very  we ll.  In  addi ­ tion,  repeated  tes ting  demo nstrates  that  the  di ffe rence  in  force  gener ated  between the arms  was  very  consistent  across  mul tiple  tests.  In  fact,  the  consis­ tency  in  equal ization  from  drop  to  drop  did  not  get  better  than  this  configur ati on.  When  comp ared  to the  cordele tte  equal rig, it  is  clear  that  the  sliding  X  equal­ leng th  performs  far  better.  Not  only  does  the  sliding  X  equal-l ength  system  equal­ ize  much  be tter  than  the  cordel ette  in  a  similar  situation,  it  equal izes  much  mor e  consi stently  from  fa ll  to  fall.  18 6  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nHow  do  these  configurations  compar e  in  a  situation  in  which  one mus t  buil d an  anchor  with  unequal-leng th  arms?  C.  Cordel ette  unequal  length:  This  clea rly-the-worst -configuration  tested  produces  an  absolute  average  di ffe r ence  in force  between  the  anchor  arms  of  al most  3. 5  kN,  or  roughly  780  pounds  of  force.  Aside  from  generating  the  lar gest  di ffe rence  in  force  of  the  riggings  measur ed,  the  cordele tte  unequa l-leng th  rigging  was  the  most  inconsis tent  when  repeated  measur es  of  this  di ffe rence  were  taken.  In  some  cases,  the  dif ference  in load  measur ed  was  greater  than  5  kN.  To  put  it  blun tly,  the cordele tte  un equal-leng th  configu ration  is the  poor est  per fo rming  anchor  consider ed  in  all  the  testi ng  cond ucted.  Not  only  is  equal ization  very  poor ,  the  de gree  of  equalization  varies  wildl y  from  fall  to  fa ll.  This  configuration  is  very  unpr edictable,  except that  the  di ffe rence  in the  forces  gener ated  from  a  fa ll  will  be  high.  The  cordele tte  une qual  leng th  is  simpl y  to  be  avoi ded.  D.  Sliding  X  unequal  length:  The  fourth  configuration  ex ami ned is  the  sliding  X  unequa l-le ngth  anch or .  This  rigging  produces,  on  average,  an  absolute  di ffe rence  in  force between  anchor  arms  of  appr oximately  1  kN  as  a  res ult  of  a  factor  1  fa ll,  putting  it  on  par  with  the equali zation  obtained  using  a  cordele tte  with  equal  arm  lengths.  Though  the  equal ization  offe red  by  the  sliding  X  unequal  is on  par  with  the  cordele tte  equa l,  both  are  inferior  to  the  sliding  X  equal.  Of the two  unequal -arm  configurations  ex amined,  ho wever ,  it  is  very clear  that  the  sliding  X  unequal  is  the  way to go.  In terms of  consistenc y  in  equal ization  from  test  to  test,  the  sliding  X  unequal­ leng th  configuration  was  as  cons istent  in  the  absolute  di ffe rences  in  load  gener ­ ated  ac ross  repeated  fa ll s.  Interesting ly,  though,  while  it  tended  to  be  very  cons istent  across  repeated  measu res,  this  anchor  was  also  the  most  lik ely  of  all  configur ations  to  produce  an  occasional  extr eme  dif fere nce  in  load.  In  other  words,  although  tests  sho wed  this  configuration  to  be  generall y  consi stent,  it  gen­ erated  some  unpr edic tably  dr eadful  equali zati on.  Su mmar y:  This  ini tial  series  of  testing  firmly  est ablishes  the  sliding  X  as  supe ­ rior  in  terms  of  load  di stribution,  while  at  the  same  time  suggesting  that  the  mate­ rials  used  played  only  a  mi nor  role.  While  the  equa l-armed  cordel ette  dis tributes  a  dynamic  load  to  an  acceptable  degree  (ba rely) , and  will  no  doubt  rem ain  a  viable  option  in  that  configuration,  a  cordele tte  rigged  with  unequal  arms  is  an  inferior ­ and  li kely  hazardous- choice  when  co ntrasted  with the more  effi cient  load  dis tri­ bution  of  the  sliding  X.  The  Sliding  X- Why  Unpredictab le?  The  sl iding  X  with  unequal  arms  showed  acceptable  but  sometimes  un predictable  loading.  While  sti ll  far  superior  to  the cordele tte  with unequal  arms,  we  wond ered  if  switching  out  a  gear  compo nent - mainl y  the  power  point  biner -might  pr oduce  BE LA Y  ANCHOR S  18 7  \nmore  equal  loadin g.  This  idea  came  from  other tests that  suggested  the X  was  prone  to  binding on  itself  (the  \"clutch  effect\" ), and  that  a  wide-mouth,  anodized  biner  co uld  greatly  reduce,  if not  elimi nate,  the  clutch  effe ct.  During  testing  Jim  Ewing  noticed  that  the  X,  or  cross ing  of  the  cord  or  webbing,  naturally wanted  to  settle  right  on  the  biner .  In  rigging the  sliding  X  for  this  round  of  tests,  he manu all y  forced  the  cross ing  to  occur  on  one  or  the  other  side  of  the  bi ner  in  order  to  avoid  the  clutching  effect  (i.e.,  separ ated  str ands).  He  also  used  an  anodized,  wide-mouth  (pear - shaped)  biner  for  this  set  series  of  drops.  To  inv esti­ gate  the role  of  the  clutch  effe ct,  additional  tests  were  conducted.  Pieces  of  cord  and  webbing  tied in  14 0cm  to  15 0cm  loops  were  used,  the  dynamic  load (1  00  kg)  was  dropped  on  1  0.2  Sterl ing  Kosmos  lead  rope  and  the drops  equaled  fall  factor  1  on O.Sm  of  rope  (star ting  leng th)  between  figure  eight  knots.  In  addi tion,  the  long  leg  equaled  1  OOcm  +1- 3cm,  the  shor t  leg  equaled 45cm  +1- 3cm  and  the  angle  between  legs  equaled  0  degrees.  Again,  during  tests,  the  str ands  of  the  anchor  were  manuall y  separ ated  on the  biner .  Her e  is  what we  fou nd.  The sliding  X  unequal  with  an  anodized wide-mouth  biner  produces, on  aver­ age,  a  di ffe rence  in force  between  anchor  arms  of  ap proximately  0.5  kN  as  a  result  of  a  factor  1  fa ll.  In other  words,  the  equalization  achie ved  using  this  configuration  is  better  than  that  achie ved  using  the  sli di ng  X  unequal  leng th  (about  1  KN), and  a  bit  worse  tha n that  obtained  for  the  sliding  X  equal  leng th  (about  0.2  kN).  Over  repeated  tests,  di ff erences  in  kN  gener ated  by  this  configur ation  varied  at  about  the  same  degree  produced  by  the  sli ding  X  equal-leng th configura tion.  This  demons trates  that  by  remo ving  the clutch  effect,  one  can ach ieve  equal ization  superior  to  that  obtained using  the  sliding  X  une qual and  remove  the  chance  of  an  occasional  lack  of  equali zati on.  While  it's  im practical  in  the  field  to  separ ate  the  str ands  of  the  sliding  X,  doin g  so  while  adding  a  wide -mouth, anodized  bine r  did  res ul t in  near  ideal  equaliz ation  (basically  12 5  pound s  of  di ffe r ence  for  a  1, 500- to  2,0 00-p ound  dynamic  load).  This  begged  for yet  another  round  of  tests  using  the  anodi zed  bin er,  but  not  separ ating  the  str ands  of  the  sliding  X.  Yet  in  the  process  of  re viewing  the  data  and  looking  closely  at  the  sliding  X  itself,  it  became obvious  that  the  sticking  point  was  the  cross  in  the  sling /cord,  the  actual  X  in  the  sys te m.  So  long  as  lim iter  knots  were  used -as  they  al ways  should  be  to  limit  ext ensi on-another  option  presented  itself:  Elimi nate  the  X  and  simpl y  clip  two  locking  biner s  (with  both  \"mouths\"  fa cing  down  and  out)  in to  the  individual  str ands  of  the  sling  between  the  li miter  knots.  This  rigging  system  was  coined  the  \"equale tte .\"  To  determ ine  how  the  equa lette  compar es  to  the sliding  X  and  the  cordele tte  unequal,  a  new  round  of  testi ng  was  conduc ted.  (Note:  Because  it  is  much  mor e  di ff icult  to  ach ie ve  equal ization  with  an  unequal -leng th arm  configuration,  testing  18 8  CLIMBING  ANCHOR S  \nfocused  on  that  mode.)  Ag ain,  to  maintain  consistenc y,  tests  on  the  equale tte  were  per formed  using  pieces  of  cord  and  we bbing  tied  in  14 0cm  to  15 0cm  loops,  the  dynamic  load  (1  00  kg)  was  dropped  on  1 0.2  Sterling  Kosmos  lead  ro pe  and  the  drops  equaled  fa ll  factor  1  on  O.Sm  of  rope  (sta rti ng leng th)  between  figure  eight  knots. In  addition,  the  long  leg  equaled  1  OOcm  +1- 3cm,  the  shor t  leg  equaled  45cm  +1- 3cm  and  the  angle  between  legs  equaled  0  degrees.  E.  Equa lette  unequal  length:  The  equale tte  unequal-leng th  configuration  outp erforms  the  sliding  X  unequal-leng th  configur ati on,  and  it  per forms as we ll  as  the  sliding  X  unequal  with  a  wide-mouth  bine r.  Of  course,  un like the  sliding  X  unequal  wide -mouth  configur ati on,  the  equal ette  has  the  dis tinct  advantage  of  being  practical  to  use  in  the  fi eld.  Equal ization  with  unequal  legs  is di ff icult,  and  though  the  equale tte  did  not  equalize  as  wel l  as  the  best- case  scenario  (s liding  X  with  equal  legs),  it  performs  very  we ll.  In  fact,  the  equale tte  offers the best  equal­ ization among the  unequal-arm  riggings  considered.  Though  the  variation  from  test  to  test  is  greater  for  the  equale tte  unequal  com­ pared  to  the  sliding  X  unequal  with  a  wide-mouth  bin er,  the  actual  abil ity  to  equal­ ize  by the  equale tte  is  so far superior  to  the  sliding  X  that  it  continues  to  be  the  best  choice.  In  sum, this  round  of  results  sh ows  that  the  equale tte  with  unequal  arms  provides  equal ization  equ ivalent  to  that  seen  in  the  sliding  X  equa l-leng th  rig­ ging, and  in  instances  when  one  requir es  an  anchor  with  unequal  arm  lengths,  the  equale tte  per forms  sign ificantly  better  than the  trad itional  sliding  X  and  vastly  bet­ ter  than  the  unequa l-leng th  cordele tte.  ::otdo:� l'3tt&  equal  )(e qual  cord�le tte>  unequal  X  unequal  equalette  uneq •.1al  _,  i  ---�  '  0  3  4  :5  Abo;o!ute  value:  of  dtffat  enc\"'  bel'vef'n  leg&_  ktJ  BELA Y  ANCHORS  18 9  \nNote  about  the  Quad  Extensive testi ng was  also  carried out  on  the  \"quad\"  system  alr eady  described  in  this  chapt er.  Si nce  the  quad  is  essent iall y a  doubled  equale tte,  and  si nce  tests  on  the  quad  rev ealed  num ber s  virtually  iden tical  to  the  equal ette,  an  ill ustrated  argu­ ment  about  the  quad  was  consider ed  super fluous  to  this  discus sion.  Shock Loading  One of the  lo ngest  ongoing  debates  (and  one  that  largely ,  if  not  entir ely ,  has  been  devoid  of  any  test data)  is  the  sub ject  of  \"shock  loading. \"  Because  this  term  has  no  meaning ful  definition,  it  usually  is  mor e  confusing  and  mi sleading  than  in formative.  The  conventi onal  definition  impli es  a force  so  sudden  and terrific it  could  break  bin­ ers  and  snap  sl ings.  The  issue  of  ext ension  in  an  anchor  has  al ways  been  a  par a­ mount  concern  to  climbe rs,  who  feared  such  ext ension  could  cause  this  shock  loading.  When we  looked  to  see  what data  had  been gener ated  to  suppor t  this  claim,  we  found  none,  and  so  we  set  out  to  conduc t  some prelimi nary  tests.  Relevant  to  our  discussion  of  rigging  strat egies,  the key  issue  was  what  hap­ pens when  one  leg  of  a  dynamically  equal ized  system  fa ils  and  the  load  falls  to  the  re maining  leg.  Some have  speculated  that  the  load  somehow  mu ltiplies  between  the  time  of  the  initial  loadi ng/arm  fa il ure,  creating  shock  loading  on the  rema ining  leg.  As  covered  earlier  in  this  book, all  dynamically  equal ized  anchor s  are  only  viable  if  they  use  limi ter  knots  to  limi t  possible  ext ension.  Given that these are  in  place,  we  wondered  what the  testing  might  divulge  when  one  arm  is  allo wed  to  fa il  and  a  dynamic  load  is  sustained  by  the  remaining  arm.  Here is how  we  went  about  the  testi ng.  Leg-Failure  Te st of  Equalette  This  test  used the  same  setup  as  previous  unequal-leg  tests  but  with  the  short  leg  conne cted  with  a  \"fuse.\"  The  fuse  is  meant  to  break  before  the  long  leg.  We reused  a  sample  of  rope  from  ear lier  drop  tests  since  a  dyna mi c  ro pe changes  very  little  after  mul tiple  factor  1  drops,  making  the  total  force  gener ated  fa ir ly  consistent.  Also,  using  the  same  piece  of  climbing  rope  greatly  in creased  the  chances  of  observing  potential  shock  loading  since  after  repeated  dr op  testing  the rope is  only  a  little  mor e  dynamic  than  a  piece  of  static  line.  If  a  shock  load  wer e  ever  going  to  happen,  it  would  happen  no w.  It  should  be  noted  that  when  using  a 1  00  kg  mass  and  low-stretch  rope,  the  forces  are  some what  higher than one  wo uld  expect  with  a  fa ll  factor  of  1.  The  dr op  tower  computer  program  produces  a  force/ti me  cur ve  that  is  qui te  jagged  imm ed iately  after the  leg  fa ilur e, indic ating  lots  of  vibration.  It is obvious  on  the  cur ve  at  what  point  the  fuse  fails.  Im medi ately  after  the  fuse  bl ows,  there  is  a  19 0  CLIMBING AN CHORS  \nsharp  drop  in force  fo ll owed  by  the  vibr ation,  which  is  then  fo ll owed  by  a  nor mal­ looking  curve.  The  peak  force  varied  depending  on  the tenac ity  of  the  fuse.  The  str onger  the  fuse,  the  lower  the  peak  force  on the  re maining  leg;  the  weaker  the  fuse,  the  higher  the  peak  force  on  the  remaining  leg.  Another  in teres ting  fi ndin g  from  these  tests  is  that  the  sum  of  the  force  experienced  by  each  anchor  leg  decreased  as  the  fuse  load  is  increased.  In  short,  ther e  is  no  \"load  multipl ication\"  between  the  ini tial leg  fa ilur e  and  the  mass  slamming  onto  the  rema ining  anchor  poin t  In  other  words,  this  series  of  testi ng  demons trates  concl usively  that  no  cata­ strophic  shock  loading  and  no  \"load  multiplicat ion\"  occur  as  a  result  of  the ext ension.  Sh ock -Loading  Conclusion:  In clim bing  sys tems,  all  the  compon ents  have  a  degree  of  res il ienc y.  These  are  by and  lar ge  only  maxed out  when  a  sect ion  of  unbela yed  static  line  or  hig h-t ensi le-strength  cord  sustains  a  dynamic  load that  is  tr ansm itted  dir ectly  to  the  anchor ,  such  as when  a  leader  clips  off  to  an  anchor  with  a  tech-cord  daisy chain, climbs  up  2 feet  and  slips,  fa llin g 4  feet  dir ectly  onto  the  an chor .  Yo u  can  bust  biner s  this way  because  the gear  can't  handle  mass  deceler ating  that  qui ckly.  Stretch  and  give  allo w  the  mass  to  deceler ate  sl ower.  In the  daisy  chain  fa ll  described  above,  you  basically  have  the  equi valent  of  a  headon  collisi on-some­ thing  that's  not  going  to  happen  when you're  on  a  dynamic  climbing  rope  that is  run ning  through  a  belay device, and when  you're  clipped  into  the  anchor  with the  climbing  rope.  Here  ext ension  simp ly  means  that  the  next  anchor  that  holds  will  be  subjected  to  the  initial  load,  minu s  what  the  fi rst  leg/piece  absorbed.  The  load  does  not  in crease  or  multiply  between  the  ini tial  fa ilur e  of  a  leg  and  the  resultant  loading  on  the  re maining  leg(s).  Mater ials  Te st ing  so  far  has  produced  several  impor tant  and  some  une xpected  findings.  Cordel ettes  by  far  do  the  poor est  job  of  equal izat ion .  The  sliding  X  equal  and  the  equale tte  unequal are clearly the best  configurations  in  terms  of  equal izati on.  We  wo nder ed,  however,  what  role  was  played  by  the  sling  materials  used  in the  tests.  We  first  looked  at  the  cordele tte.  Here  is  what  we  learned .  The bar s in  the gr aphs  represent  the  mean  of  the  absolu te  difference  between  forces  gen erated  between  the  two  arms  of  the  anchor . In  some  cases,  these  bar s  are very  small -close  to  zero -meaning  that  each  arm  of  the  anchor  receives  about  half  of  the  force  gener ated  by  the  fa ll  (i.e.,  equal izati on) .  In other  instances,  the  di fference  in  forces  transm itted  to  each  arm is  qui te  large,  su ggesting  that  one  arm  of  the  anchor  is  experiencing  a  dispropor tionate  amoun t  of  the  force  gener­ ated.  As  was the  case  in  earlier  tests,  we  ideally  wou ld  like  to  see  the  force  dis trib­ uted  equall y  between  the  two  arms  of  the  anchor .

I<:N  Considering  the  cordele tte  equal  riggings,  slight  dif fere nces  are  noted  among  the  sling  materials,  though  su bstantively  they  appear  to  per form  equally  we ll.  A  di f­ ferent  conclusion  is  reached  when  examining  resu lts  from  the  cordele tte  unequal  configur ati on.  Findings  show that  nylon  or  Perlon  provide  better  equal ization  than  Spec tra  or  hi gh-tensil e-stre ngth  cord,  in  the  case of  a  cordele tte  with  unequal  legs.  This  sug gests  that for  equaliz ation  purposes, nylon  is the  pr eferred  material  to  mak e  cordele ttes.  Though  these  results are  based  on  limi ted  data, it  appear s  that  for  a  cordele tte  unequal  setup,  sling  mat erial  does  matter.  Tests  show much  smaller  dif fere nces  in  equal ization  across  sling  materials  for  the  sliding  X  unequal  and  for  the equal ette  unequal.  In  these  configur ati ons,  sling  material  does  not  influence  equali zati on  greatly .  19 2  CLIMB lNG  ANCHORS  \n1/:!  �ncr.  nvlc.11  11  !1  C  tn�il  nvlon  'm.n  perlon  112  1nch  Suectre  bmm  1&.11  <.Otcl  r  2  3  4  '5  Mt>oin  at>�olur�  dlfteren.:e  be<W<'Eln  c.ord:\"lett&  arms  kN  11/Hl tnch  nylon  61nm  te cll  c.ord  r  1  2  3  4  '5  M&an ab�I)IUIP  dtfl etqnoo  l.oqtv. ,een  r:ot t 'PI<'II&  t llm�.  kN  These  findings  reinfor ce  what  we  concluded  in  the  pr evi ous  sections -that  regard less  of  sling  material,  the  cordele tte  is  a  terrible  choice,  the  sliding  X  is  a  bet­ ter  choice  and  the  equal ette  is the best  choice  of  riggings  tested  for  achieving  equali zation  of  two  unequal  legs.  In  addition,  for  use  with  two  side -by- side  pri mar y  anchor s,  the  quad  is  also  a  handy  system that  provides  easy use, brute  strength  and  excellent  equalization.  Summary  The  Ster ling  tests  were  invaluable  because  they  ana lyzed  rigging  syste ms,  rather  than  equi pment,  and  they  appl ied  dynamic  loading  (repli cating  the  forces of  a  real  world  leader  fall)  on  a  dynamic  rope,  as  opposed  to  \"slow  pull\"  or  static  loading  on  BE LA Y  ANCHORS  19 3  \nstatic  ropes.  Slo w-p ull,  static-ro pe  testing is  a  mode  follo wed  in many  eva luations  but  one  that  has  que sti onable  relevance  to  real  world  climbin g  fa lls.  Cli mbers  do  not  lead  on  static  ropes,  and  fa ll s  do  not  happen  slo wly .  Test ing  determ ined  that  unless  a  rigging  system  features  per fectly  equal-le ngth  arms  and  is  used when  the  loading  dir ection  doesn't  change  so  much  as  a  single  degree  (and  these are  alr eady  imposing  lim itations),  equal ization  and  a  fixed  power  poin t  are  mutually  ex clusive.  The  deduction  is  that future  refi neme nts  in  rigging  systems  will probably move  away  from fixed  power  poin ts,  with  their  big,  be efy  knots  that,  ironical ly,  wer e  long  considered  earma rks  of  secu rity  itself.  Some  thi rty  years  ago  the  sliding  X  introduced the  concept  of  a  sliding  power  poin t,  and  the  refi neme nts  and  tentative  new  syste ms  spawned  by  the  Sterl ing  tests  are  the  fi rst  baby  step  in  taking  the  concept  into  the  twenty-first  centu ry.  Because  this  work  is  just  beginning,  I  expect  over  the  next  few  year s  to  see  many  mor e  options  featu ring  a  sliding  power  point.  Simpli fied  ver sions  of  the  Tra ngo  Equal izer ,  as  well  as  other  \"pul ley\"  rigging  sys tems,  have  alr eady  been  pr esented  and  offe r  much  hope  for  futur e  inno vati on.  No  doubt  others  will  devise  new  sys­ tems  that  featur e  strate gies  not  yet  imagined.  A  truly  revo lutionar y  method  is  yet  to  appear;  we'r e  basically  still  tw eaking  syste ms  based  on the  cordele tte  and  the  slid ing  X.  But  no  matter  what  the  futur e  turns  up,  it  is doub tful  that  any  single  rig­ ging  strategy  will prove \"best\"  across  the  board.  A  combina tion  of  techniques  will  surely  be  req uir ed  to  cover  the  varied conditions  found  in real world rock  climbin g.  That much  said,  an  obvious  question  remains  una nswered:  If  the  old  systems­ name ly,  the  cordel ette- tested  so poorly  in  terms  of  equal ization,  why  don't  more  cordel ette- rigged  anchor s  fa il  in  the field?  The  answer  is  lik ely  what  we  touched  on  earlier:  Few  belay  anchor s  (no  matter  the  rigging  system  emp loyed)  have ever  fa iled  because  so  few  anchor s  ever  experience  a  factor  2  fa ll.  But  for  those  very  few  teams  that one  day  will  experience  such  a  fal l-where  the  leader  plu nges  dir ectly  onto  the  bel ay-we  now  have  a  much better idea  of  what  actually  works  in  terms of  equal ization.  It  remains an  engineering  mar vel  that  we  can  hand-place  a  col lection  of  widg ­ ets  in to  features  in  the  rock  and  swiftly  tie  them  off  so  the  load  gets  somewhat  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  matrix.  No  doub t  we  originally  under estimated  how  tricky  equal ization  was  to  ach ieve,  lar gely  set tl ing  for  the cordele tte  on  the  streng th  of  its  appar ent  simpli city  and  util ity.  It  ca me  to  pass that  any  other  rigging  strategy  was  judged  by  the  simpl icity  of  the  cordele tte  (and  other  syste ms  were  generally found  lacking),  while  all  along  the  cordele tte,  if  sub jected  to  a  dynamic  load, was  rarely  perf orming  as  advert ised .  Experience  now  sh ows  that, in terms  of  rigging  syste ms,  the  acronym  KISS  (Keep  It  Sim ple  Stu pid)  is  valuable  only  up  to  a  poin t.  We  are  free-so loing  a  slipp ery  19 4  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nslope  if we  th ink  the  onl y  rigging  system  worth  using  is  one  so  facile  that a  ra nk  beg inner  can  arrange  it  with  no  tr aining  and  no  discrimi nation -a  tota ll y  foolpr oof  setu p.  !n  almo st  any  potentially  lethal  end eavor ,  participa nts  are  required  to  learn  the  basic  procedures  to  safeguard  the adventure.  Climber s  simpl y  have  to  master  some  essential  prot ocols,  and that's  a  fact.  To  expect  rigging  to  be  as  simpl e  as  tyi ng  your  shoes  is  to  expect  too much  from  the  syste ms.  Compar ed  to  what  oth­ ers  learn-and  must  exercise -to  fly  a  plane  or  scuba dive,  clim bers  are  obl iged  to  know  very  little  indeed.  But  it  will  never  get  to  the  point  wher e  clim ber s  must  know  noth ing  at  all.  All  told,  the  St erling  tests  are  but  one  page in an ongoing  investigation  that  will  sir e  in novati ons  as  long  as  humankind  is  inclined  to  pull down on  the Big  St one.  A  recent  thread  on  rigging  strategies  featured  on  Rockcl imbing .com  received  mor e  than  35,000  view s  and  gener ated  500 -plus  res ponses  in  fifteen days. Many  ing en­ ious  rigging  strategies  were  pr esented,  and  mor e  are  sur ely  forth coming.  The  bulk  of these  will  come  from  grass  root  sour ces  for  a  simpl e  rea son:  Rigging  strate gies  are  not  produc ts,  and  climbing  companies  only  test  what  they  sell.  The  gauntlet  has  been  thrown  down:  Future  rigging  methods  must  be  buil t  on  standard  cord  or  webbing  and  cost  no mor e  than  the  cord or  webbing  itself.  No  doodads,  wid gets,  rap  rings  or  pricey  sewing.  Since  there  is  li ttle  pr ofit  to  a  man ufa cturer  in  the  simpli ­ fied  rigging  methods  most  of  us  rely  on,  ther e's  no  motivati on  to  develop  or  test  such  methods,  even  if  the  results  are  inv alu able  to  real  world  climbe rs.

In  the  past the  basic  rigging  methods  included  the  cordele tte,  the  slidin g  X  and  the  crafty  use  of  sli�g s  and  clo ve  hitches.  Recent  tests,  ho wever ,  have  det ermined  that  the  cordele tte  is  dependabl e  only  when  the  arms  of  the  system  are  of  pe rfect  leng th.  The  equale tte, a  new  variation  of  the  cordel ette,  is  showing promise  as  a  viable  replacement  and  has  thus  far  received  solid  reviews  following  extensive  field testing.

Spreading  the  Load  A  fa ll  gener ates  forces,  and  you  want  the  im pact  of  those  forces  equali zed  over  and  absorbed  throughout  the  entire  anchor  matrix.  A  wise  stockbroker  has  a  broad  por t­ fol io.  He  doesn't  toss  all  his  dough  into  a  single  fund,  no  matter  how  blue  the  chip.  Same  thing  with  belay  an chors.  We  spread  the  load  over several  sound  primar y  placem ents  and  reduce  the  possibil ity  that the  whole  matrix  will  fai l.  And that is,  and  al ways  wiil  be, the  primar y  function  of  a  belay  anchor -to  hold no  matter  what.

For  exa mple,  if  we  have  four  nut s  in  a  line  and  tie  them  all  off  with  a  cordele tte,  the  impa ct  force  will,  to  some  degree,  get  distributed  over  all  four nuts.  Realistical ly,  this  system  pr ovides  im per fect  equal ization,  so  one  of  the  anchor s- the  anchor  conn ected  to  the  shor test  arm  of the  rigging  system-is  inevitably sust aining  mo st  of the  load.  •  An  automatic  equalizing  (dy namid self -adjusting)  system  emplo ys  various  sling  configurations  between  the  anchor s  so  all  pi eces  shar e,  to  greater  or  lesser  degrees,  any  appli ed  load,  even if  the  loading  dir ecti on  changes.

Some­ times belay anchor s  feature  a  combin ation  of  automatic  and  static  equalizing con­ structs.  For  instance, you  might  end  up  with  several  pairings  of  nu ts  equal ized  with  the  sliding  X,  these  being lashed  together  with  a  cordel ette  or an equale tte  to  create  a  comple te  syste m.  Mode rn  Rigging  Trends  For  many  year s  most  clim bers  tied  dir ectly  into  a  belay  anchor  with  the  lead  rope.  The  rope  tie-in  was  consider ed  the  qui ckest,  simp lest  and least  gear-intensive  method,  and was  used  ten  to  one  over  all  other  setups. About fifteen  year s  ago  the  cordele tte  was  invented  to  spread  the load  quick ly  and  some what  evenly  between  two  bomber  bolts  on  sp ort-cl imb  belay  anchor s.  Over  time  the  cordele tte  became  a  popular  rigging  technique  for trad  climbin g.  The  notion  was  to  maximize  the  overa ll  strength  of  the  anchor  sys tem,  while  red ucing  the  belay  switch-over  time  if  one  climber  was  leading  all  of  the  pitches,  or if  the  pa rty  had  three  or  more  clim ber s.  As  popular  as  the  cordele tte  is,  recent  tes ting  has  shown  that  it does  not  achie ve  an  acceptable  level of  equal ization  when  the  arms of  the  system  are  of  un equal  leng ths.  While  the  cord ele tte  remains  a  viable  rigging  system in  the  equal­ arm  configuration  (connecting  two-a nd  only  two-p lacements).  the  equale tte  is  looking  good  in  both  the lab  and  the  fi eld,  and  it  app ears  to  be  a  logical option  when the  arms  of  the  rigging  system  are  of  unequal  leng th,  and  even  when  they  ar e  not.  Another rigging  method,  built  on  the  sliding  X,  is  also  a  primar y  rigging  strat­ egy.  Mor e  recen tly,  climber s  have started  in tegrati ng  both the  cordele tte  and  the  sliding  X  into  an  anchor  matrix.  For  example,  you  might  equalize  several  place­ ments  with  the  slidin g  X,  then  use  the  cordele tte  to  statically  equali ze  the  power  point.  Because  the  cordel ette,  sliding  X  and  equa lette  are  primary  rigging  techniques,  it's  essential  to  under stand  the  pros  and  cons  of  each.  It  is  here,  in  this  critical  di scussion,  that  the SRENE criteria  jump  to  full  life,  for  only  when  appl ied  can  the  concep ts  be made  clear.  The  reason  for having  started  with  a  discussion  of  climb­ ing  forces  (and  dir ection  of pull)  is  to  help  you  mak e  these  what-if  anal yses  more  con crete.  And  it's  pretty  much  what-if  from  her e  on  out.  Whe.n  to  Use  Wh at  Tr ying  to  est ablish  when  to  use the  equale tte,  sliding  X  or  cordele tte  is  a  sli pper y  business.

Let's  fi rst  look  at  the  cordele tte,  the  mo ther  of  all  rigging  methods for  mor e  than  a  decade.  CORDELETTES  Until  recent  testi ng  showed  its  shor tcomings,  a  cordele tte  was  generally  used  to  di stribute  the  load  between  two,  three  or  fo ur  (rare)  primar y  placem ents  in  a  belay  anc ho r.  The  cordele tte  minimi zes  the  numb er  of  carabiner s,  sl ing s  and  quickdr aws  req uir ed to  connec t  the  placemen ts  in an  anchor  matrix  (u nle ss  you  just  use  the  rope),  thereby  justif ying  its size and weight.  A  sta ndard  cordele tte  consis ts  of  an  18 -f oot  piece  of  5.5mm  high -t ensile  cord  or  7mm nylon and  has been  commonly  used  by  guides  to  create  a  single  poin t  fo r  connecting  cli ents  to  all  the  individual  anchor s  of  a  belay  or as  a  toprope  anchor  sys te m.  The  cordele tte  is  tied  into  a  loop  with  a  tri ple  fisherman' s  knot  (if  using  high­ tensile  cord)  or  a  double  fisherman's  knot  (if  using  nylon cord)  and  clipped  in to  each  of  the  primar y  anchors.  A  loop  of  the  cord  is  then  pulled  down  between  each  of  the  primar y  pieces.  If  you  have  three  pi eces  in  your  belay  anchor ,  you'll  get  three  loops  that  must  then  be  pulled  tight  toward  the  antici pated  loading  dir ection  (di rec tion  of  pull).  As  a  statically  equal ized  syste m,  the  cordele tte  is  designed  to  withst and  forces  in  a  specific  dir ection  of  pull,  and  that  dir ection  must  remain  con- 14 8  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  ",

The  relative  displa cem ents  are  thus e,  e/2,  and  e/3,  which  means  the  tension  in the  2-foot  arm  is  half  the  tension  in  the  1- foot  arm,  and  the  tension  in  the  3-foot  arm  is one­ third  the  tension  in  the  1- foot  arm.

To  summar ize,  Professor  Gold stone  is  pointing  out that  when  the  arms  of  the  cordele tte  are  of  di ffe rent  leng th,  equal ization is  compromised  by  stretch  in  the  arms,  with  the  arm  that  stretches  least  in  this  case  bearing  better  than  half  (55  per ­ cent)  of  the  load.

Off -Axis  Load ing  on  Cordelettes  So far  our  examples  assume  that  loading will  come  from  dir ectly  below  the  power  point,  which  gives  the  cordele tte  its  best  chance  of  equalizing  the  load  evenly  between  the  arms.  What  happens,  then,  with  load  angle  changes,  when  the  dir ec­ tion  of  pull  comes  from 5  or  1 0  degrees  off  the  vertical  axis? To  visualize  the  vec­ tor s  in volved,  consider  this  paraphrased  explanation  of  Dr .  D.  F.  Merchant,  from  his  exce llen t  cave  rescue  treatise,  Lif e  on  a  Line.  Whene ver  you  combine  two  anchor s  to  a  single  power  point  (as  you do  with  a  cordele tte)  there  will  be  an  angle between  the m.  The  smaller  this  angle,  the  smaller  the  load  on  each  anchor  when  a  dir ect  down­ load  is  appl ied  to  the  power  point.  If  your  load  pulis  outside  the  angle  of  yo ur  an chors,  at  least  one  conn ection  (arm  of  the  cordele tte)  will  be  slack,  bearing  li ttle  to  no  load,  with  the  ot her  conn ection  taut  to  the  load-bearing  placement.  If  your  load  comes from  a  fixed  dir ection,  min ­ imi zing  the  angle  between your  anchor s  is  the  main  aim.  If  you  need  a  range  of  motion, then  making  sur e your  anchor s stay  loaded  is  a  com­ promise against  mini mizing  the  angles.

So  far  we've  see  that  the  random  changes  in  the  cordel ette's  arm length may  well  result  in  li mited  ini tial  loading  on  at least one  primar y  placement  as the  anchor  matrix  is  loaded  and  the  stre tching  process  begins.

This  means  that  Pr ofess or  Gol dstone's  example  (three  pl acemen ts  in  a  vertical  crack),  where  the  long  arm  of  a  cordele tte  absor bs  18  percent  of  the  load,  could  be  a  hig h  estimate.  \"In  fact,\"  writes  Goldstone,  \"my  suspicion  is  that  for  many  anchor s  with  three or more  piec es  in  any  configurat ion,  it  is  quite  possible  that  nearly  all  the  load will  be  impar ted  to  a  single  anc hor ,  even  if  the  load  comes  from  the  expec ted  dir ecti on.\"  The  fact  is  that  any  static  equal ization  setup  is  mor e  rea listically  an  ex ample  of  redundanc y  than  an  exam ple  of  equalization.  We  should  alw ays  keep that in  mind  when  we're  building  an anchor  with  a  cordele tte.  Other  valuable  fe edback  comes  from Jim  Ewi ng,  the  quali ty  control  manager  for  Sterl ing  Ropes,  who  noted  dur ing  testing  that  low-stretch  hig h-t ensile  cord  al ways  weighted  one  leg  first,  which  fa iled, then  the  next  leg,  which  fa il ed,  then  fi nall y  the  last leg, which  fa iled.  Bottom  line:  1.  A no-ext ension  anchor  (inc luding  the  cordel ette)  is  a  distributed  anchor ,  not  an  equali zed  one,  and  it  is  possible  that  at  least  one  of  the  anchor  pieces  will  expe­ rience  li ttle  or  no load  (unless  other s  fa il ).  2.  The  abili ty to  di strib ute  forces  to  all  anchor s  is  in creased  by  the  use  of  stret chier  materi al,  a  strong  endorsement  for  using  a  7mm  nylon  {nylon)  for  any  rigging  system.  Point  2  is  co mm only  trotte d  out  by  those  rec omm ending  the  cordel ette  for  all  anchor ing  setups.  They  claim  that  cord  stretch  provides  off -axis  load  sharing,  and  it  mig ht  somewhat,  but  the  que stion  becomes  this:  What  ava ilable  material  provides  the  ratio  of  stretch  best su ited  to  prom ote  load  sharing  on  a  sh ock-loaded  cordele tte?  An  answer  comes  again  from  Jim  Ewing  at  Sterl ing  Ropes,  who  tested  two  cordel ette  setups  (hand  tied),  one with  hi gh-t ensile  cord,  the other  with  lo w­ tech  nylon  (nylon) .

To most  every  trad  climb er's  relie f,  the  sliding  X  appar ently  resolved  two  lo ng-st anding  concerns:  (1 )  how  to  achie ve  maxi mum  equal ization  between  two  primar y  pi eces  of  protecti on,  and  (2)  how  to  safeguard  against  changes  in the  dir ection  of  loadi ng.  Functionally  effe ctive  within  a  wide  axis,  the  sliding  X  can  be  loaded  from  various  dir ections,  and  the  \"X\"  will  dynami­ cally  sh ift  to  help  distribute  the  force  between  two  pieces.  Rigging  th e  Sliding  X  The  sliding  X  is  simple  to  construct,  but  a  proper  twist  in the  sliding  X  sling  is  essenti al.  When  you  bungle  twis ting  the  X  into  the  sli ng, the  sliding  X  is  tota ll y  use­ less  if  one  placement  fails. To  confirm  proper  rigging  after  conn ecting  the  sliding  X  to  the  placemen ts,  simpl y  clip  a  biner  into the  X,  weight  the  placemen ts  and  slide  the  biner  back  and  forth  along the  sling  to  ensur e fl uid  and  stately  functi oning.  The  sliding  X  pr ovi des  true  automatic  equali zation;  the  drawback  is  that  it  can  allo w  ext ension in  the  system  if  the  slin gs  are  long  and  one  of  the  anchor s  fa ils.  To  mini mize  the  potential  ext ension  in  longer  slings,  tie  an  over hand  \"limi ter\"  knot  in  the  long  leg  of  the  sling ,  just  above  the  tie-in  point.  (Keep  in  mind that  this  lim iter  knot,  while  it  reduces  the pos sibil ity  for  ext ension,  also  by  its  very  nature  limi ts  the  equal izati on  properties  of the  sliding  X.)  Mak e  sur e  the  angle  between the  two  legs  of the  sling  is  not  too  large.  If  the  angle  is  lar ger  than about 45  degrees,  use  a  15 8  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  ",

While  it's  an  ingenious,  simple  and  ef fective  rigging  method,  the  main  concern  is  that  the  sliding  X  violat es  the  No  Ext ension  criteria  of  SRENE.  Put  simp ly,  the  sliding  X  is  used  to  conne ct  two  pr imar y  placemen ts.  If  one  of  the  two  pri­ mary  anch ors  should  blow  when  loaded,  the  force would  \"extend\"  or  dr op  onto the  re maining  place­ ment  equid istant  to  the  slack  in  the  sl ing.  The  concern  is  that  the  force  dumping  onto  the  second  pi ece  mig ht  possibly produce  cascade  zippering  of the  remain­ ing  pi eces  of  the  anchor .  The  pos­ sibi lity  of this has  alw ays  re ma ined  a  black  mark  against  the  sli ding  X,  but Craig  Connally  (a long  with  recent testing)  lar gely  dispr oved  the  prev aili ng  paranoia  about  the  minimal  ex tension  (with  the  limi ter  knots)  pos sibili ­ ties  with  the  sliding  X.

Sliding X:  Normal  Usage  Let's  look  closely  at  how  the  sliding  X  is  normally  engaged  and  dr aw  some  rules  of  thumb  for  gener al  usage.  With solid,  two-b olt  anchor s  on  mul ti  pitch  spor t  climb s  (where  the  issue  of  exte nsion  is  dim inished  and  the scale tips  toward  equal ization  or  redundanc y),  setup  is  quick  and easy.  Plus,  the  sliding  X  saves having  to  leave  two  draws  at  the  anch or.  And  for  anchor s  placed in  non-hor izontal  orientations -say,  two  cams  in  a  slanting  crack -the  sliding  X  can  conn ect  the  pair  so  they  are  largely  equalized  while  provi ding  vastly  mor e  mul tidir ect ional  capa cities  than  if  you  were  to  tie  the  same two  pieces  together  with  either  a  cordel ette  or with knots  tensioned  in  a  sli ng.  In  fact,  whenever  you  wish  to  dynamically  dis tribute  the  load  between two  pieces,  the  sliding  X  is  both  effe ctive  and  the  best-known  method.  16 0  CLIM BIN G  ANCHORS  ",

Ch anges  in  th e  Direction  of  Pull  Although  this  was  covered  in  earlier  chap ters,  it's worth  repeating:  Every  clim ber  having  to hand  build  a  belay  anchor  on  a  route  that  traverses  left  or  right  dir ectly  off the belay  faces  a  particula rly  ch al lenging  situation.  Pitons,  fixed  pin s  and (to  a  lesser  degree)  SLCDs  are  all  mul tidir ec ti onal,  but every thing  else  is  unidir ecti onal,  so  any  mul ti dir ectional  capacities  must  be  pr ovi ded  by  the rigging.

Much  of  the  load  comes  when  the  leade r's  str aigh t-down  fall  begins  to  be  pulled  into  the  arc,  and  it  continues  until  he  is  in  the  fa ll line.

While  upward  forces  at  a  belay  are  gener ­ all y  small  compar ed  to  downward forces, I've  repeatedly  seen this  oper a  play  out  in the gym: A  bela yer  is  grossly  outweighed  by  some  lug  climbing  on  a  toprope.  From  neglect  or  sloth  the  svelte  belayer  has  for egone  a  ground  anchor .  Jumbo  pitches  off  and  the  belayer is  dir ectly  wrenched  5  to  20  feet  into  the  air .  I'v e  wit­ nessed  bela yers  hoisted  ali  the  way  to  the  top  anchor ,  30  feet  up.  Jumbo,  who  is  now  on  the  ground, acts  as  a  cou nter we ig ht/a nchor ,  and  the  belayer  returns  to  the  deck  by  ra ppelling  down  the  rope  via  th eir  belay  device,  through  which the  rope  runs.  This  scenario  is  part icular  to  the  gym,  where  the  routes  are  vertical  to  over­ hanging  and  the  top  rope  usually  runs  over  a  chubby  pipe  on the top  of  the  route.  On  a  cl iff  the  rope  runs  through  carabiners,  at  ra dicall y  tighter  angles  that  won't  al low  such  a  meteoric  hois t  as  found  in  the  gym fiasco.

In  the  Sier ra  Club  ver sion,  one  end  of  some  goldlin e  rope  was  atta ched  to  a  buck et  of  concr ete  weighing  roughly  12 0  pounds.  The  ro pe  ra n up an  over hanging  wall to  an  anchor  on  top-or  was  conn ected to  a  cross-beam  in  a  gy mnasium,  as  the  case may have  been -t hen  back  down to  a  bela yer  on the  gr ound.

The  question  is:  What are  the  circumstances  in  which  up ward forces  are  great  enough  to  warrant  oppositional  placemen ts  in  the belay  anchor ?  Let's  place  our selves  back  on  the  rock  and  see  what  qu estions  arise.  Consider  a  lea der  cli mbing  abo ve  a  hanging  bel ay.  If  she  fa lls  off  and  is  ar rested  by the  Jesus  Nut,  for  ins tance,  or  pro  she  has  placed  higher , the  belayer  will  be  pulled  upward,  or  dir ectly  toward the first  piece  of  pr otection  off  the  bel ay- which  is  generally  upward  sinc e  most  climbs  go  up.  But  what  is the  actual  power  of  this  upward  force  on  a  bel ayer?  Most  of  us  have held  leader  falls  that  have  jerked  us  skyward  hard and  fast,  but  even  on  steep  sport  routes,  if the belayer and  the  leader  weigh  roughly  the  same,  when have  you  ever  seen  a  bel ayer,  following  a  leader  fa ll,  left  in  midair , stret ched  taut  against  an  anchor  str aining  ag ains t the  upward  force?

In  fact  one  of  the  ongoing  debates  in  the  climbing  communi ty  is  whether  or  not  upward-oppositional  pl acem ents  are  necessar y  at  all.  Some  people  favor  forgo ing  upward  force  opposi­ tionals because they  think  opposi­ tion  a  Is  waste  time,  ener gy  and  gear  while  \"needle ssly\"  comp licating  the  syste m.  Propon ents  of  oppositional  anchor s  raise  the poss ibi lity  of the  anchor  being  upr ooted  when  the  bela yer  is  dragged  up ward  in  the cour se  of  holdin g a  fa ll.  For this  to  ever  hap pen,  the  bela y  anchor  wo uld  have  to  be  set  in  vertical  cracks  and  consist  of  nuts  and,  less  lik e ly,  cams-pro  that  might  con­ ceivably  be  pluck ed  clean  if the  bela yer  were  yanked  a  suf f icient  dis­ tance  above  the  anch or .  I've  never  read  of  an  instance  wher e a  be  layer  actually  got  dr agged  above  the  anchor  and  where  the  primar y  placeme nts  in  the  belay  anchor  itself were  pluck ed  from  the  crack  like  cl oves  from  a  holi day  ham.  We  know that  during  a  leader  fa ll  (held  by pro  abo ve  the  belay),  sl ight  lif t  of  the  bel ayer's  body and flex  and  give  in  the  system  act  as  peak  force  reducer s,  absorb­ ing much  of  the  fall's  kinetic  ener gy  before  the  anc hor  is  ever  loaded.  If  nothing  else,  rope  sli p/stretch  will  lik ely  preclude  a  meteoric  hoist,  even  when  little  rope is  out.  But  that 's  with  a  bela yer  who  weighs  ro ughly  the  same  as  the  leader .  Get  a  leader  who  weighs  twice  as  much  as  the  bel ayer,  and  the  lif t factor  becomes  sign if­ icant  no  mat ter  the  angle.  Here  the  peak  force  reduction  enjoyed  by  the  body  of  a  lar ge  climber  is  null  and  void.  And  so  is the  main  argument  against  setti ng  nu ts  for  an  upward  pull:  No matter  the  fa ll  scenario,  the  belayer  is  not  lik ely  to  be  li fted  far  17 6  CL IMBING  ANCHOR S  ",

To  answer  the fundamental  questions  raised  in  that  discussion,  we  needed  to  gen erate  some  har d  data.  The  aim  of  tes ting  was  to  determ ine  performance  dif ferences  between  the  slidin g X  and the  cordele tte  when  both  systems  were  subjec ted  to  the  same  dyna mic  load  (as  found  in  a  real  world  fa ll) .

On  the  recommendation  of  Kolin  Powick,  qua lity  assurance  manager  at  Black  Diamond,  the  physical  testing  was  conduc ted  by  Jim  Ewing,  research  and  develop­ ment  manager  at  St erling  Ropes.  Ewing  is  both  a  world-class  climb er  and  an  engi­ neer  with  years  of  experience  testing  on Sterling's  UIM  drop towers and  computer  assist  gear ,  and  he  is  widely  considered  the  leading  tester  in  the  Uni ted  States.  The  tests  took  weeks  and  many  late  nights  to  com ple te  (upwards  of  200  drop  tests  were  per fo rmed)  and  went  far  in  answering  many  long -st anding  questions about  riggi ng  sys tems.  Very  much  an  ongoing  team  ef fort,  Ewing's  raw  data  was  worked  up  by  nat iona lly  recognized  statis tical  exper ts  (and  climb ers)  Dr.  Lawrence  Hamil ton  and  Dr .

Last ly,  the  tests  led  to  a  di scovery  phase  involving  several  new  rigging  stra tegies  that were  field  tested  and  refi ned  by  profess ional  guides  Bob  Gaines  and  To m  Cecil  and  others.

This  involv ed  ex amining  the  fo llowing  eleme nts  of  the  anchor  chain.  1)  The  prim ary  pl acements.  Hundr eds  of such  tests  alr eady  exist  on  the  strength of  \"this\"  bolt  and  \"that\"  camming  device.  Further  anal yses  could  te ll  us  li t­ tle  about  the  appl ied  function  of  either  the  sli ding  X  or  the  cordele tte.  2)  The  conn ecting  points.

Again,  we  ini tially  belie ved  such  testi ng  wo uld  divulge  little  about  per form­ ance  dif f erences  per  either  rigging  system-a  belief  we  later  revised.  3)  Mater ials.  Because  pr evious  testi ng  indi cated  performance  di fferences  between  old- style  nylon and  hi gh-t ensil e-strength  cord and  webbing  (Dyneema,  Spec tra,  etc.).  we  decided  to  use  a  variety  of  commonl y  used  materials  for  all  testing.

Wrestl ing  with  this  lo ng-st anding  question,  Jim  conduc ted  a  battery  of  tests  that  stro ngly  suggest  shor t  ext ension does  not  cause  any  in crease  in  forces  (load  mul tiplic ation)  beyond  the  initial  load  on  the  system  prior  to  the  fa ilur e  of  one  pri­ mary  anchor  placement.  This  is  a  fasc inating,  involved  and  impor tant  sub ject  that  warrants  further  resear ch.  6)  Redundanc y.  In  terms of  a  belay  anch or,  a red undant anchor  is  di fferent  than  an  anchor  that  is  mer ely  backed  up.  A  redundant  belay  anchor  implies  that  the  forces  gener ated  in  a  leader  fa ll  will  never  fall  on  one  piece  of  gear .  With  a  backed  up  anchor ,  the  force  fa lls  on  a  single  primar y  anchor  placement,  and  if  that  fa ils,  the  force  then falls  on  a  second  placement,  and if  that  fa ils,  the  force  impac ts  a th ir d  placeme nt-the  dreaded  \"cascade\"  anchor  fa ilur e.  To  avoid  this  cascade  scenario  and  to  enjoy  functional  redundancy  in  a  belay  anchor  (to  avoid  loading  on  one piece  of  gear),  impac t  forces  must  be  spread  or  equalized  over  at  least  two  primar y  place­ ments.  To  determine  how  well  any  rigging  system  accomplishes  such  functi onal  redundanc y  would  ther efore  involve the  issue  of  equali zati on.  7)  Equal izati on.  Equal izati on  is  the  very  qual ity  for  which  the  sliding  X  and  the  cor dele tte  wer e  designed,  and  are  emp loyed,  to  achie ve.  After  the  previous  an aly­ sis  it  became  clear  that  the  most  meani ngful  testi ng  wo uld  determine  how well or  how  poor ly the  sliding  X  (dy namically  equal ized  system)  and  the  cordele tte  (stati­ cally  equali zed  system)  del ivered  on  their  promise  of  equalization.  To  cont rast  the  functional  equali zation  of  the  sliding  X  and  the  cordel ette,  we  decided  on the  following  test  parameters:  •  \"Slow  pull,\"  static  loading  tests  have  limit ed  bearing  on  real  world  spor t  and  adventure  climbing.

In  some  cases,  these  di ffe r ences  are  close  to  zero,  mean in g  that  each  leg  of  the  anchor  receives  about  half  of the  force.

Contrary  to  conventi onal  wisdom  and  popular  usage,  the  cordele tte,  even  with  equal-leng th  arms,  is  not  a  very  effe ctive  system  to  achie ve  equali zati on.  B.  Sliding  X  equal  length:  Te sting  of  this  anchor  configur ation  sho ws  that  on  average,  the  absolu te  di ffe rence  in  force  transferred  to  each  equal -leng th  arm  due  to  a factor 1  fall  was very  close  to  zero  (i.e.,  about  0.2  kN  di ffe r ence) .

Aside  from  generating  the  lar gest  di ffe rence  in  force  of  the  riggings  measur ed,  the  cordele tte  unequa l-leng th  rigging  was  the  most  inconsis tent  when  repeated  measur es  of  this  di ffe rence  were  taken.

This  rigging  produces,  on  average,  an  absolute  di ffe rence  in  force between  anchor  arms  of  appr oximately  1  kN  as  a  res ult  of  a  factor  1  fa ll,  putting  it  on  par  with  the equali zation  obtained  using  a  cordele tte  with  equal  arm  lengths.  Though  the  equal ization  offe red  by  the  sliding  X  unequal  is on  par  with  the  cordele tte  equa l,  both  are  inferior  to  the  sliding  X  equal.  Of the two  unequal -arm  configurations  ex amined,  ho wever ,  it  is  very clear  that  the  sliding  X  unequal  is  the  way to go.  In terms of  consistenc y  in  equal ization  from  test  to  test,  the  sliding  X  unequal­ leng th  configuration  was  as  cons istent  in  the  absolute  di ffe rences  in  load  gener ­ ated  ac ross  repeated  fa ll s.  Interesting ly,  though,  while  it  tended  to  be  very  cons istent  across  repeated  measu res,  this  anchor  was  also  the  most  lik ely  of  all  configur ations  to  produce  an  occasional  extr eme  dif fere nce  in  load.

While  the  equa l-armed  cordel ette  dis tributes  a  dynamic  load  to  an  acceptable  degree  (ba rely) , and  will  no  doubt  rem ain  a  viable  option  in  that  configuration,  a  cordele tte  rigged  with  unequal  arms  is  an  inferior ­ and  li kely  hazardous- choice  when  co ntrasted  with the more  effi cient  load  dis tri­ bution  of  the  sliding  X.

This  idea  came  from  other tests that  suggested  the X  was  prone  to  binding on  itself  (the  \"clutch  effect\" ), and  that  a  wide-mouth,  anodized  biner  co uld  greatly  reduce,  if not  elimi nate,  the  clutch  effe ct.  During  testing  Jim  Ewing  noticed  that  the  X,  or  cross ing  of  the  cord  or  webbing,  naturally wanted  to  settle  right  on  the  biner .  In  rigging the  sliding  X  for  this  round  of  tests,  he manu all y  forced  the  cross ing  to  occur  on  one  or  the  other  side  of  the  bi ner  in  order  to  avoid  the  clutching  effect  (i.e.,  separ ated  str ands).  He  also  used  an  anodized,  wide-mouth  (pear - shaped)  biner  for  this  set  series  of  drops.  To  inv esti­ gate  the role  of  the  clutch  effe ct,  additional  tests  were  conducted.  Pieces  of  cord  and  webbing  tied in  14 0cm  to  15 0cm  loops  were  used,  the  dynamic  load (1  00  kg)  was  dropped  on  1  0.2  Sterl ing  Kosmos  lead  rope  and  the drops  equaled  fall  factor  1  on O.Sm  of  rope  (star ting  leng th)  between  figure  eight  knots.  In  addi tion,  the  long  leg  equaled  1  OOcm  +1- 3cm,  the  shor t  leg  equaled 45cm  +1- 3cm  and  the  angle  between  legs  equaled  0  degrees.  Again,  during  tests,  the  str ands  of  the  anchor  were  manuall y  separ ated  on the  biner .  Her e  is  what we  fou nd.  The sliding  X  unequal  with  an  anodized wide-mouth  biner  produces, on  aver­ age,  a  di ffe rence  in force  between  anchor  arms  of  ap proximately  0.5  kN  as  a  result  of  a  factor  1  fa ll.  In other  words,  the  equalization  achie ved  using  this  configuration  is  better  than  that  achie ved  using  the  sli di ng  X  unequal  leng th  (about  1  KN), and  a  bit  worse  tha n that  obtained  for  the  sliding  X  equal  leng th  (about  0.2  kN).  Over  repeated  tests,  di ff erences  in  kN  gener ated  by  this  configur ation  varied  at  about  the  same  degree  produced  by  the  sli ding  X  equal-leng th configura tion.  This  demons trates  that  by  remo ving  the clutch  effect,  one  can ach ieve  equal ization  superior  to  that  obtained using  the  sliding  X  une qual and  remove  the  chance  of  an  occasional  lack  of  equali zati on.  While  it's  im practical  in  the  field  to  separ ate  the  str ands  of  the  sliding  X,  doin g  so  while  adding  a  wide -mouth, anodized  bine r  did  res ul t in  near  ideal  equaliz ation  (basically  12 5  pound s  of  di ffe r ence  for  a  1, 500- to  2,0 00-p ound  dynamic  load).  This  begged  for yet  another  round  of  tests  using  the  anodi zed  bin er,  but  not  separ ating  the  str ands  of  the  sliding  X.  Yet  in  the  process  of  re viewing  the  data  and  looking  closely  at  the  sliding  X  itself,  it  became obvious  that  the  sticking  point  was  the  cross  in  the  sling /cord,  the  actual  X  in  the  sys te m.  So  long  as  lim iter  knots  were  used -as  they  al ways  should  be  to  limit  ext ensi on-another  option  presented  itself:  Elimi nate  the  X  and  simpl y  clip  two  locking  biner s  (with  both  \"mouths\"  fa cing  down  and  out)  in to  the  individual  str ands  of  the  sling  between  the  li miter  knots.

Of  course,  un like the  sliding  X  unequal  wide -mouth  configur ati on,  the  equal ette  has  the  dis tinct  advantage  of  being  practical  to  use  in  the  fi eld.

Shock Loading  One of the  lo ngest  ongoing  debates  (and  one  that  largely ,  if  not  entir ely ,  has  been  devoid  of  any  test data)  is  the  sub ject  of  \"shock  loading. \"  Because  this  term  has  no  meaning ful  definition,  it  usually  is  mor e  confusing  and  mi sleading  than  in formative.  The  conventi onal  definition  impli es  a force  so  sudden  and terrific it  could  break  bin­ ers  and  snap  sl ings.  The  issue  of  ext ension  in  an  anchor  has  al ways  been  a  par a­ mount  concern  to  climbe rs,  who  feared  such  ext ension  could  cause  this  shock  loading.  When we  looked  to  see  what data  had  been gener ated  to  suppor t  this  claim,  we  found  none,  and  so  we  set  out  to  conduc t  some prelimi nary  tests.  Relevant  to  our  discussion  of  rigging  strat egies,  the key  issue  was  what  hap­ pens when  one  leg  of  a  dynamically  equal ized  system  fa ils  and  the  load  falls  to  the  re maining  leg.  Some have  speculated  that  the  load  somehow  mu ltiplies  between  the  time  of  the  initial  loadi ng/arm  fa il ure,  creating  shock  loading  on the  rema ining  leg.  As  covered  earlier  in  this  book, all  dynamically  equal ized  anchor s  are  only  viable  if  they  use  limi ter  knots  to  limi t  possible  ext ension.  Given that these are  in  place,  we  wondered  what the  testing  might  divulge  when  one  arm  is  allo wed  to  fa il  and  a  dynamic  load  is  sustained  by  the  remaining  arm.  Here is how  we  went  about  the  testi ng.  Leg-Failure  Te st of  Equalette  This  test  used the  same  setup  as  previous  unequal-leg  tests  but  with  the  short  leg  conne cted  with  a  \"fuse.\"  The  fuse  is  meant  to  break  before  the  long  leg.  We reused  a  sample  of  rope  from  ear lier  drop  tests  since  a  dyna mi c  ro pe changes  very  little  after  mul tiple  factor  1  drops,  making  the  total  force  gener ated  fa ir ly  consistent.  Also,  using  the  same  piece  of  climbing  rope  greatly  in creased  the  chances  of  observing  potential  shock  loading  since  after  repeated  dr op  testing  the rope is  only  a  little  mor e  dynamic  than  a  piece  of  static  line.  If  a  shock  load  wer e  ever  going  to  happen,  it  would  happen  no w.  It  should  be  noted  that  when  using  a 1  00  kg  mass  and  low-stretch  rope,  the  forces  are  some what  higher than one  wo uld  expect  with  a  fa ll  factor  of  1.  The  dr op  tower  computer  program  produces  a  force/ti me  cur ve  that  is  qui te  jagged  imm ed iately  after the  leg  fa ilur e, indic ating  lots  of  vibration.  It is obvious  on  the  cur ve  at  what  point  the  fuse  fails.  Im medi ately  after  the  fuse  bl ows,  there  is  a  19 0  CLIMBING AN CHORS  ",

These  are  by and  lar ge  only  maxed out  when  a  sect ion  of  unbela yed  static  line  or  hig h-t ensi le-strength  cord  sustains  a  dynamic  load that  is  tr ansm itted  dir ectly  to  the  anchor ,  such  as when  a  leader  clips  off  to  an  anchor  with  a  tech-cord  daisy chain, climbs  up  2 feet  and  slips,  fa llin g 4  feet  dir ectly  onto  the  an chor .  Yo u  can  bust  biner s  this way  because  the gear  can't  handle  mass  deceler ating  that  qui ckly.  Stretch  and  give  allo w  the  mass  to  deceler ate  sl ower.  In the  daisy  chain  fa ll  described  above,  you  basically  have  the  equi valent  of  a  headon  collisi on-some­ thing  that's  not  going  to  happen  when you're  on  a  dynamic  climbing  rope  that is  run ning  through  a  belay device, and when  you're  clipped  into  the  anchor  with the  climbing  rope.  Here  ext ension  simp ly  means  that  the  next  anchor  that  holds  will  be  subjected  to  the  initial  load,  minu s  what  the  fi rst  leg/piece  absorbed.  The  load  does  not  in crease  or  multiply  between  the  ini tial  fa ilur e  of  a  leg  and  the  resultant  loading  on  the  re maining  leg(s).  Mater ials  Te st ing  so  far  has  produced  several  impor tant  and  some  une xpected  findings.  Cordel ettes  by  far  do  the  poor est  job  of  equal izat ion .  The  sliding  X  equal  and  the  equale tte  unequal are clearly the best  configurations  in  terms  of  equal izati on.  We  wo nder ed,  however,  what  role  was  played  by  the  sling  materials  used  in the  tests.  We  first  looked  at  the  cordele tte.  Here  is  what  we  learned .  The bar s in  the gr aphs  represent  the  mean  of  the  absolu te  difference  between  forces  gen erated  between  the  two  arms  of  the  anchor . In  some  cases,  these  bar s  are very  small -close  to  zero -meaning  that  each  arm  of  the  anchor  receives  about  half  of  the  force  gener ated  by  the  fa ll  (i.e.,  equal izati on) .  In other  instances,  the  di fference  in  forces  transm itted  to  each  arm is  qui te  large,  su ggesting  that  one  arm  of  the  anchor  is  experiencing  a  dispropor tionate  amoun t  of  the  force  gener­ ated.  As  was the  case  in  earlier  tests,  we  ideally  wou ld  like  to  see  the  force  dis trib­ uted  equall y  between  the  two  arms  of  the  anchor .  BELA Y  ANCHOR S  19 1  ",

A  di f­ ferent  conclusion  is  reached  when  examining  resu lts  from  the  cordele tte  unequal  configur ati on.

This  sug gests  that for  equaliz ation  purposes, nylon  is the  pr eferred  material  to  mak e  cordele ttes.  Though  these  results are  based  on  limi ted  data, it  appear s  that  for  a  cordele tte  unequal  setup,  sling  mat erial  does  matter.  Tests  show much  smaller  dif fere nces  in  equal ization  across  sling  materials  for  the  sliding  X  unequal  and  for  the equal ette  unequal.  In  these  configur ati ons,  sling  material  does  not  influence  equali zati on  greatly .  19 2  CLIMB lNG  ANCHORS  ",

Cli mbers  do  not  lead  on  static  ropes,  and  fa ll s  do  not  happen  slo wly .  Test ing  determ ined  that  unless  a  rigging  system  features  per fectly  equal-le ngth  arms  and  is  used when  the  loading  dir ection  doesn't  change  so  much  as  a  single  degree  (and  these are  alr eady  imposing  lim itations),  equal ization  and  a  fixed  power  poin t  are  mutually  ex clusive.  The  deduction  is  that future  refi neme nts  in  rigging  systems  will probably move  away  from fixed  power  poin ts,  with  their  big,  be efy  knots  that,  ironical ly,  wer e  long  considered  earma rks  of  secu rity  itself.  Some  thi rty  years  ago  the  sliding  X  introduced the  concept  of  a  sliding  power  poin t,  and  the  refi neme nts  and  tentative  new  syste ms  spawned  by  the  Sterl ing  tests  are  the  fi rst  baby  step  in  taking  the  concept  into  the  twenty-first  centu ry.  Because  this  work  is  just  beginning,  I  expect  over  the  next  few  year s  to  see  many  mor e  options  featu ring  a  sliding  power  point.

No  doubt  others  will  devise  new  sys­ tems  that  featur e  strate gies  not  yet  imagined.  A  truly  revo lutionar y  method  is  yet  to  appear;  we'r e  basically  still  tw eaking  syste ms  based  on the  cordele tte  and  the  slid ing  X.  But  no  matter  what  the  futur e  turns  up,  it  is doub tful  that  any  single  rig­ ging  strategy  will prove \"best\"  across  the  board.  A  combina tion  of  techniques  will  surely  be  req uir ed  to  cover  the  varied conditions  found  in real world rock  climbin g.  That much  said,  an  obvious  question  remains  una nswered:  If  the  old  systems­ name ly,  the  cordel ette- tested  so poorly  in  terms  of  equal ization,  why  don't  more  cordel ette- rigged  anchor s  fa il  in  the field?  The  answer  is  lik ely  what  we  touched  on  earlier:  Few  belay  anchor s  (no  matter  the  rigging  system  emp loyed)  have ever  fa iled  because  so  few  anchor s  ever  experience  a  factor  2  fa ll.  But  for  those  very  few  teams  that one  day  will  experience  such  a  fal l-where  the  leader  plu nges  dir ectly  onto  the  bel ay-we  now  have  a  much better idea  of  what  actually  works  in  terms of  equal ization.  It  remains an  engineering  mar vel  that  we  can  hand-place  a  col lection  of  widg ­ ets  in to  features  in  the  rock  and  swiftly  tie  them  off  so  the  load  gets  somewhat  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  matrix.  No  doub t  we  originally  under estimated  how  tricky  equal ization  was  to  ach ieve,  lar gely  set tl ing  for  the cordele tte  on  the  streng th  of  its  appar ent  simpli city  and  util ity.  It  ca me  to  pass that  any  other  rigging  strategy  was  judged  by  the  simpl icity  of  the  cordele tte  (and  other  syste ms  were  generally found  lacking),  while  all  along  the  cordele tte,  if  sub jected  to  a  dynamic  load, was  rarely  perf orming  as  advert ised .

Though  we've  seen  that  a  real  world  factor  2  fall  gener ates  forces  that  are  less than those  registered  in  the  lab  drop  test,  the  pa rty  line  re mains  the  same:  If  a  belay  cannot  sust ain  a  factor  2  fa ll,  14 4  CLI MBING  ANCHOR S  \nit  is  not  \"good  enough.\"  And  yet  the  vast  majority  of  the  most  experienced  climb ers  on  the  planet have  li ttle  dir ect  experience  with  a  worst-case  scenario,  fac­ tor  2  fa ll.  American  climber and  mathematics  pr ofessor  Richar d  Gol dstone  pu ts  it  this  way:  \"My  sense  is  that circumstances  severe  enough  to  result  in  total anchor  fail­ ur e  have  happened  in  the  field  to  no  more than  a  handful  of  climbe rs  dur ing  the  nearly  forty -nine  years  I've  been  climbi ng.\"  Cr aig  Connally  says  the  same  th ing  another  way:  \"The  reason  ther e's  so  much  sc rewy  advice  about  fa lls  and  anchor  building  is  that  the  roped  safety  system  hardly  ever  gets  stres sed  to its  limi ts.\"  If  tr aditional  wisdom  insis ts  that  we  build  belay  anchor s  to  sust ain  a  factor  2  fa ll,  and  precious  few  of  our  anchor s  have ever  sustained  anyth ing  close  to  such  loading,  on  what real world  experiences  and on  what  hard information  are  we  bas­ ing  our  rec ommenda tions?  While  ther e  is  a  glaring  lack  of  defin itive  information  about  real  world  anchors,  this  lack  is  som ewhat  countered  by  field  testing  carried  out  by  milli ons  of  climbe rs  annuall y.  Un for tuna tely  for  our  discus sion,  but  fortunately  for  climbe rs,  the  bulk  of  this  field  testi ng  ent ails  fall  forces  in  the  factor  .3  to  .5 ra nge.  Better  to  have  a  lar ge,  contr olled  database  on  factor  2  falls that  could  tell  us  what  tech ni ques  worked  and  what  did  not  so  we  could  base  our  re comme ndations on  that data.  As  it  sta nds,  we  must  dr aw  our  information  from  a  di ffe rent,  and  adm itte dly ,  shallo wer  we ll.  That  said,  we  were able  to  in itiate  an  extensive  series  of  lab  tests  specifically  for  this  book,  and  the  test  results yielded  inv aluable  information  about  rigging  sys tems.  This  is  only  a  sta rt,  ho wever .  Many  mor e tests  by many  more  people  are  req uired  to  wrestle  with  this  very  slip pery  sub ject.  Spreading  the  Load  A  fa ll  gener ates  forces,  and  you  want  the  im pact  of  those  forces  equali zed  over  and  absorbed  throughout  the  entire  anchor  matrix.  A  wise  stockbroker  has  a  broad  por t­ fol io.  He  doesn't  toss  all  his  dough  into  a  single  fund,  no  matter  how  blue  the  chip.  Same  thing  with  belay  an chors.  We  spread  the  load  over several  sound  primar y  placem ents  and  reduce  the  possibil ity  that the  whole  matrix  will  fai l.  And that is,  and  al ways  wiil  be, the  primar y  function  of  a  belay  anchor -to  hold no  matter  what.  We've  all had  pr o  rip  out;  some  of  us  have  had two  poi nts  of  pr o  rip out.  But  it's  unlik ely  you  will  ever  read  about  a  fa ile d  anc hor  that  was  set  in  good  rock,  well­ equal ized,  red undant  and  fa shioned  to  absorb  loading  in  the  dir ection  of  the  pull.  Three  or  fo ur  bomber  nuts  and  SLCDs,  judi ciously  equalized  and  set  in  good  rock,  sim ply  are not  going  to  fa il no  matter  how  fa r a  leader  might  fall  on  th em.  Let's  mak e  no  mi stake  about  it:  A  leader  can  gener ate  only  so  much  imp act  force,  and  a  viable  anchor  can  readily sustain  it.  BE LA Y  ANCHOR S  14 5  \nBy  using  oppositional  elem ents  in the  anchor  (if  requi red)  and  proper ly  equal iz­ ing  them to  the  primar y,  bombpr oof  anchors,  the  anchor  becomes  multidir ec­ tional.  You  can  ya nk  and  tug  and  fa ll  on  it  from  many  angles  and  that  baby  will  sti ll  hold.  Again,  th at's  the  bottom  li ne  with  a  belay  anch or-it  must hold,  no  matter  what.  While  we  have  str essed  the  critical  impor ta nce  of  getti ng  a  secur e  placement  just  off  the  bel ay- the  Jesus  Nu t-a nd  have  clar ified  that  the  top  placement  alw ays  sustains  the  hig hest  loading  during  a  fa ll,  we  nevertheless  strive  to  build  our  anchor s  to sustain that  worst-case  scenario  fa ll  because if  all  our  pro  rips  out,  we  still  have  a  str ong and  secur e  anchor  to  save  the  day.  But it's  a  plain  fact: No  ma tter  how  superb  the  rigging,  we  almo st  never  attain  un iform  equa lization  between  primar y  placeme nts  in  the  anc hor  matrix.  At  best  we  ac hie ve  a  somewhat  even  dis tribution  of  loading.  Knowing  that  equal ization  is  a  rel­ ative  term  does  not  keep  us  from  striving  to  build  belay  anch ors  with  the  following  featu res:  •  Distributes  the  load  as  evenly  as  possible  between  the  component  par ts  of  the  anchor  system  •  Has  a  minimum  of  slack  between  the  various  tie-in  poi nts  •  Uses  a  rigging  method  and/or  multidir ecti onal  compo nents  capable  of  se lf-adjust­ ing,  or  automatically  redistributing  the load  as  the  load ing  dir ection  chan ges  (say ,  as  the be  layer  shif ts  position,  or the  belayed  climber  pi tches  off  and  swings,  or  if  the belayer  gets  yanked  up ward)  •  Can  withsta nd  the  greatest  load  a  leader  can  place  upon  it  STAT IC  AND  AUTOMATIC  EQUALIZATION SYSTEMS  There  are  two  kinds  of  equalizing  syste ms:  stat ic,  pseudo -eq ualizing  syste ms  (also  called  pre-eq uali zed  systems) and  automatic  (dynamic  or se lf-adjusting)  syste ms.  The  fo llowing  pages,  pho tos  and  commen tary  explor e  these  syste ms in  detail,  but  to  start  out,  under sta nd  these  shor t  def ini tions:  •  A  static  equalizing  system  refers  to  a  gr ouping  of  nuts,  pitons,  bolts,  etc.,  which  are  tied  off  together  with  no  slack or  adjustabil ity  in  the  sys te m.  For  exa mple,  if  we  have  four  nut s  in  a  line  and  tie  them  all  off  with  a  cordele tte,  the  impa ct  force  will,  to  some  degree,  get  distributed  over  all  four nuts.  Realistical ly,  this  system  pr ovides  im per fect  equal ization,  so  one  of  the  anchor s- the  anchor  conn ected  to  the  shor test  arm  of the  rigging  system-is  inevitably sust aining  mo st  of the  load.  •  An  automatic  equalizing  (dy namid self -adjusting)  system  emplo ys  various  sling  configurations  between  the  anchor s  so  all  pi eces  shar e,  to  greater  or  lesser  degrees,  any  appli ed  load,  even if  the  loading  dir ecti on  changes.  The  use  of  14 6  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nlim iter  knots  to  reduce  ext ension  on  slidin g  X  configurations  creates  something  of  a  hybrid anchor  between  automatic  and  static  equa lization,  but  for  the  purposes  of  this  book,  we  will  consider  those  anchor s  to  be  part  of  this  catego ry.  Some­ times belay anchor s  feature  a  combin ation  of  automatic  and  static  equalizing con­ structs.  For  instance, you  might  end  up  with  several  pairings  of  nu ts  equal ized  with  the  sliding  X,  these  being lashed  together  with  a  cordel ette  or an equale tte  to  create  a  comple te  syste m.  Mode rn  Rigging  Trends  For  many  year s  most  clim bers  tied  dir ectly  into  a  belay  anchor  with  the  lead  rope.  The  rope  tie-in  was  consider ed  the  qui ckest,  simp lest  and least  gear-intensive  method,  and was  used  ten  to  one  over  all  other  setups. About fifteen  year s  ago  the  cordele tte  was  invented  to  spread  the load  quick ly  and  some what  evenly  between  two  bomber  bolts  on  sp ort-cl imb  belay  anchor s.  Over  time  the  cordele tte  became  a  popular  rigging  technique  for trad  climbin g.  The  notion  was  to  maximize  the  overa ll  strength  of  the  anchor  sys tem,  while  red ucing  the  belay  switch-over  time  if  one  climber  was  leading  all  of  the  pitches,  or if  the  pa rty  had  three  or  more  clim ber s.  As  popular  as  the  cordele tte  is,  recent  tes ting  has  shown  that  it does  not  achie ve  an  acceptable  level of  equal ization  when  the  arms of  the  system  are  of  un equal  leng ths.  While  the  cord ele tte  remains  a  viable  rigging  system in  the  equal­ arm  configuration  (connecting  two-a nd  only  two-p lacements).  the  equale tte  is  looking  good  in  both  the lab  and  the  fi eld,  and  it  app ears  to  be  a  logical option  when the  arms  of  the  rigging  system  are  of  unequal  leng th,  and  even  when  they  ar e  not.  Another rigging  method,  built  on  the  sliding  X,  is  also  a  primar y  rigging  strat­ egy.  Mor e  recen tly,  climber s  have started  in tegrati ng  both the  cordele tte  and  the  sliding  X  into  an  anchor  matrix.  For  example,  you  might  equalize  several  place­ ments  with  the  slidin g  X,  then  use  the  cordele tte  to  statically  equali ze  the  power  point.  Because  the  cordel ette,  sliding  X  and  equa lette  are  primary  rigging  techniques,  it's  essential  to  under stand  the  pros  and  cons  of  each.  It  is  here,  in  this  critical  di scussion,  that  the SRENE criteria  jump  to  full  life,  for  only  when  appl ied  can  the  concep ts  be made  clear.  The  reason  for having  started  with  a  discussion  of  climb­ ing  forces  (and  dir ection  of pull)  is  to  help  you  mak e  these  what-if  anal yses  more  con crete.  And  it's  pretty  much  what-if  from  her e  on  out.  Whe.n  to  Use  Wh at  Tr ying  to  est ablish  when  to  use the  equale tte,  sliding  X  or  cordele tte  is  a  sli pper y  business.

Let's  fi rst  look  at  the  cordele tte,  the  mo ther  of  all  rigging  methods for  mor e  than  a  decade.  CORDELETTES  Until  recent  testi ng  showed  its  shor tcomings,  a  cordele tte  was  generally  used  to  di stribute  the  load  between  two,  three  or  fo ur  (rare)  primar y  placem ents  in  a  belay  anc ho r.  The  cordele tte  minimi zes  the  numb er  of  carabiner s,  sl ing s  and  quickdr aws  req uir ed to  connec t  the  placemen ts  in an  anchor  matrix  (u nle ss  you  just  use  the  rope),  thereby  justif ying  its size and weight.  A  sta ndard  cordele tte  consis ts  of  an  18 -f oot  piece  of  5.5mm  high -t ensile  cord  or  7mm nylon and  has been  commonly  used  by  guides  to  create  a  single  poin t  fo r  connecting  cli ents  to  all  the  individual  anchor s  of  a  belay  or as  a  toprope  anchor  sys te m.  The  cordele tte  is  tied  into  a  loop  with  a  tri ple  fisherman' s  knot  (if  using  high­ tensile  cord)  or  a  double  fisherman's  knot  (if  using  nylon cord)  and  clipped  in to  each  of  the  primar y  anchors.  A  loop  of  the  cord  is  then  pulled  down  between  each  of  the  primar y  pieces.  If  you  have  three  pi eces  in  your  belay  anchor ,  you'll  get  three  loops  that  must  then  be  pulled  tight  toward  the  antici pated  loading  dir ection  (di rec tion  of  pull).  As  a  statically  equal ized  syste m,  the  cordele tte  is  designed  to  withst and  forces  in  a  specific  dir ection  of  pull,  and  that  dir ection  must  remain  con- 14 8  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nstant or the  effe ctiveness  of the  cordele tte  is  greatly  compr omi sed.  In  shor t,  rig­ ging  the  cordele tte  in  the  dir ection  of  anticipated  load ing  is  absolu tely  vital.  Align  the  fisherman's  knot  in  the  cordel ette  so  it  is  belo w  the  hig hest  piece  in  the  matrix,  which  keeps the  bulk y  fisherman' s  knot  from  in terf ering  with the  power  point  kn ot-a  common  mi stake  for  beginners.  Next, tie an  ov erhand  knot,  or  if  you  have  enough  cord,  a  figur e  eight  knot,  near  the  tie-in  point  Clipping  a  biner  in  at  this  point  greatly  fa cilit ates  tyi ng  the  knot  with  nice,  equal loops.  Tie  the  power  point  loop about  4  inches  in  diame ter,  roughly  the  same  size  as  the belay loop  on  your  ha rness.  The  cordele tte  has  now  formed  three  separ ate,  redundant  loops that  offe r  no  exte nsion  if one of  the  primar y  placem ents  fails.  The  problem with  this  con­ figuration  is  the  issue  of  equal­ izat ion.  Lab  tests  clearly  show  that  un less  the  cordele tte  is  conf igur ed  with  per fectly  equal­ leng th  arms  it  does  not  achie ve  a  remotely  ad equate  de gree  of  equali zation  between  the  pri­ mar y  placem ents .  Instead the  bulk  of  any  loading  is  absorbed  by  the  shor test  arm  in  the  sys­ tem.  He nce  the  cordele tte  works  best  in  those  situations  where  it  can  be  configured  with  equal-leng th  arms and con­ nected to  side -by-s ide  place­ me nts  (such  as  bo lts  atop  a  sport  climb),  and  also  where the  dir ection of  pull  remains  a  con­ stant-stra ight  up and  straight  down .

This  provides  a  mor e  dynamic  system and  allo ws  quick  escape  if  need  be.  Alw ays  make sure  the  rope  remains  the  primar y  att achm ent,  owing  to  it's  dyna mic  (stretch)  properties. One  disturbing,  recent  trend  (and  pr oba­ bly  90  per cent  of  novice trad  clim ber s  do  this)  is  to  use  a  da isy chain  for  your  atta chment.  This  static  conn ection- which  daisy chain  man ufactu rers  warn  agains t- pr ecludes  the  climbing  rope  from  acting  as  a  shock  abso rber.  In  the  dou­ ble  fata lit y  on  The  Step  at  Ta hqu itz  Rock,  the  be  layer was  atta ched  to  the  cordele tte  with  a  small  length  of  hig h-t ensile  cord,  rath er  than  with  the  main  rope.  Never  do  so.  In  summar y,  when  the  primar y  placements  of  the belay  anc hor  are  of  equal  dis­ tance  from  the  power  point  and  bomb er,  and  the  dir ection  of  possible  loading  (pull)  remains  constant,  a  statically  equalized setup  lik e  the  cordele tte  is  a  viable  choice.  Again,  the  bi ggest  shor tc oming  of  the  cordele tt e---o ne  that keeps some  clim be rs  from  using  the  cordel ette  at  al l-is  that  it  loses  almo st  all,  if  not all,  of  its  equal ization  properties  if  the  loading  dir ection  changes.  In  shor t,  a  cordele tte  sac­ rifices  equali zation  pr operties  if it  is  im pacted  in  a  dir ection  for  which  it is not  rigged,  and  to  a  lesser  degree,  in  the  dir ecti on  for  which it was rigged.

With practice,  rigging  anchor s  with  cordele ttes  becomes  quick  and  strai ghtforwa rd.  Cordelettes  and  Equa lizatio n-an  Ex ample  Because  the  cordele tte  was  for  many  years  a  favored  rigging  strategy  and  because  we  are  now  su ggesting  otherwise  in  many situations,  it  is  worthwh ile  to  under ­ stand  the  entire  pic ture.  You  will  certa inl y  hear  strong  re comme ndations  for  using  the  cordele tte  in  all  circumstances,  especially  from  those  not  privy  to  recent  test  results  and  the  theor etical  discussion  that  fo llo ws.  Pr ofe ssor  Richard Goldstone  has  over  the  year s  taken  a  studied  look  at  some  basic  assumptions  per  anchoring  mechanics.  In  the  following  par aphr ased  ab stract,  he  presents  a  theoretical  an alysis  (which  testing  later  confirmed)  from  which  the  cordel ette  may  never  recover  it's  reputation  for  equal izat ion.

In  this com­ mon  setup,  prov iding  the  three  arms  of  the  cordele tte  are  equally  tensioned,  many  cl im bers  as sume  that  any  loading  is  dis tributed  equally  between  the  three  plac e­ ments.  Ho wever,  this  as sump tion  is  not  true  in  general  and  may  not  even  be  appr oximately  true  in  simple  cases.  Consider  the mecha­ nism  by  which  the  cordele tte  transm its  forces  to  the  anchor  poin ts.  When the  power  point  is  loaded,  the  arms  of  the  cordele tte  stretch  a  little and  the  power  point  lowers relative  to  the  amoun t  of  stretc h.  The tension  in  each  cordele tte  arm  is  propor ­ tional  to  the  relative  stretch  of  the  arms,  and  the  relative  stretch  of  dif ­ ferent  arms  will,  in  gen­ eral,  be  di ff erent.  To  pic ture  this  in  1  fO OT  (55%  of  l.OI\\I))  Usmg a  c.ord �lette  to  conntlct  anc hors m a  vertical  ct  ack  results  in  an  anchor  that  does  not  tome  close  to  truly  equaflztng  the  forces  action,  return  to  our  simple  and  quite  preva lent  case  of  three  primar y  placem ents  in a  verti cal  line.  Suppose  that  ther e  is  1  foot from  the  power  point  to  the  lo west  anchor ,  and  that  each  of  the two  higher  anchor s  is  1  foot  above  its  pr ed ecessor.  This  means  that  the  arms  from  BE LA Y  ANC HOR S  15 3  \nthe  power  point  to  the  anchor s  are  1,  2  and  3  feet  respective ly.  When  loaded,  the power  point  experien ces  a  downward  displa cement  of  e  feet  (e  will  typ ically  be  a  sm all  frac tion).  The  relative  displa cem ents  are  thus e,  e/2,  and  e/3,  which  means  the  tension  in the  2-foot  arm  is  half  the  tension  in  the  1- foot  arm,  and  the  tension  in  the  3-foot  arm  is one­ third  the  tension  in  the  1- foot  arm.  Put  ano ther  way,  the  lo west  place­ me nt  takes  about  55  per cent  of  the  load,  the  middle  placement  takes  ab out 27  percent  of  the  load, and  the  top  placement  takes  about  18  per cent  of  the  load.  Obviously  this  contr adic ts  conventional  wisdom  about  so-ca lled  anchor  equal izati on,  which  holds  that  each  anchor  takes  on e-th ird  of  the  load.  To  summar ize,  Professor  Gold stone  is  pointing  out that  when  the  arms  of  the  cordele tte  are  of  di ffe rent  leng th,  equal ization is  compromised  by  stretch  in  the  arms,  with  the  arm  that  stretches  least  in  this  case  bearing  better  than  half  (55  per ­ cent)  of  the  load.  When  tested,  the  cordele tte  pr oved  to  equali ze  less  proficiently  than  even  Profess or  Golds tone  surmised,  which  is  why  the  cordele tte  can  no  longer  be  re commended  for  its  equal ization  pr oper ties  when  the  arms  are  of  unequal  length.  Off -Axis  Load ing  on  Cordelettes  So far  our  examples  assume  that  loading will  come  from  dir ectly  below  the  power  point,  which  gives  the  cordele tte  its  best  chance  of  equalizing  the  load  evenly  between  the  arms.  What  happens,  then,  with  load  angle  changes,  when  the  dir ec­ tion  of  pull  comes  from 5  or  1 0  degrees  off  the  vertical  axis? To  visualize  the  vec­ tor s  in volved,  consider  this  paraphrased  explanation  of  Dr .  D.  F.  Merchant,  from  his  exce llen t  cave  rescue  treatise,  Lif e  on  a  Line.  Whene ver  you  combine  two  anchor s  to  a  single  power  point  (as  you do  with  a  cordele tte)  there  will  be  an  angle between  the m.  The  smaller  this  angle,  the  smaller  the  load  on  each  anchor  when  a  dir ect  down­ load  is  appl ied  to  the  power  point.  If  your  load  pulis  outside  the  angle  of  yo ur  an chors,  at  least  one  conn ection  (arm  of  the  cordele tte)  will  be  slack,  bearing  li ttle  to  no  load,  with  the  ot her  conn ection  taut  to  the  load-bearing  placement.  If  your  load  comes from  a  fixed  dir ection,  min ­ imi zing  the  angle  between your  anchor s  is  the  main  aim.  If  you  need  a  range  of  motion, then  making  sur e your  anchor s stay  loaded  is  a  com­ promise against  mini mizing  the  angles.  This  und erscor es  the  fact  that with  the  cordel ette,  ther e  is  only  one  load  angle  where  force  is  dis tributed-in  varying  per centages -to  the  anchor  pieces.

In  The  Mount aineering  Handbook,  Cra ig  Connally  gives  a  simple  num erical  ex am ple:  \"Consider  a  two -placement  setup where the  legs  join  at  a  30-degree  angle.  If the  load  is  off  the  precise  balancing  dir ection by  10  degrees, one  anchor  wi ll  take  three  times  the  force of  the  other.\"  If  this  off -axis  load  exceeds  the  max load  of  each  primar y  protec tion  poin t,  the  pieces  will  fa il  in  succession -t he  ghastly  cascade  fa ilur e-as  the  force  shock  loads  from  one arm  to  the  next.  If the  off -axis  loading  does  not  exceed  the  max  strength  of  the  primar y  protection  point s,  redunda ncy  here  appl ies  only  as  a  backup  since  the  load  will  be  held  by  one  piece,  not the  two  or  thr ee  for  which  the  cordele tte  was  rigged  in the  fi rst  place.  (This  is not  meant  to  di scount  the  imp ortance  of  redunda nc y,  which  would  obviously  be  critical if  the  primar y  load-bearing  piece  were to  fa il .)  This  brings  us  back  to the  matter  of  stretch  in  the  arms of  the  cordele tte.  Spe cifical ly,  can  the  stretch  of  the  arms provide some  off -axis  load  shari ng?

So  far  we've  see  that  the  random  changes  in  the  cordel ette's  arm length may  well  result  in  li mited  ini tial  loading  on  at least one  primar y  placement  as the  anchor  matrix  is  loaded  and  the  stre tching  process  begins.  If  hi gh-t ensile  cord  (an  almo st  static  material)  is  used,  then  it is  poss ible  that  at  least  one  anchor  will  never  be  loaded  unle ss  ther e  is  a  fa ilur e  in  the  others.  This  means  that  Pr ofess or  Gol dstone's  example  (three  pl acemen ts  in  a  vertical  crack),  where  the  long  arm  of  a  cordele tte  absor bs  18  percent  of  the  load,  could  be  a  hig h  estimate.  \"In  fact,\"  writes  Goldstone,  \"my  suspicion  is  that  for  many  anchor s  with  three or more  piec es  in  any  configurat ion,  it  is  quite  possible  that  nearly  all  the  load will  be  impar ted  to  a  single  anc hor ,  even  if  the  load  comes  from  the  expec ted  dir ecti on.\"  The  fact  is  that  any  static  equal ization  setup  is  mor e  rea listically  an  ex ample  of  redundanc y  than  an  exam ple  of  equalization.  We  should  alw ays  keep that in  mind  when  we're  building  an anchor  with  a  cordele tte.  Other  valuable  fe edback  comes  from Jim  Ewi ng,  the  quali ty  control  manager  for  Sterl ing  Ropes,  who  noted  dur ing  testing  that  low-stretch  hig h-t ensile  cord  al ways  weighted  one  leg  first,  which  fa iled, then  the  next  leg,  which  fa il ed,  then  fi nall y  the  last leg, which  fa iled.  Bottom  line:  1.  A no-ext ension  anchor  (inc luding  the  cordel ette)  is  a  distributed  anchor ,  not  an  equali zed  one,  and  it  is  possible  that  at  least  one  of  the  anchor  pieces  will  expe­ rience  li ttle  or  no load  (unless  other s  fa il ).  2.  The  abili ty to  di strib ute  forces  to  all  anchor s  is  in creased  by  the  use  of  stret chier  materi al,  a  strong  endorsement  for  using  a  7mm  nylon  {nylon)  for  any  rigging  system.  Point  2  is  co mm only  trotte d  out  by  those  rec omm ending  the  cordel ette  for  all  anchor ing  setups.  They  claim  that  cord  stretch  provides  off -axis  load  sharing,  and  it  mig ht  somewhat,  but  the  que stion  becomes  this:  What  ava ilable  material  provides  the  ratio  of  stretch  best su ited  to  prom ote  load  sharing  on  a  sh ock-loaded  cordele tte?  An  answer  comes  again  from  Jim  Ewing  at  Sterl ing  Ropes,  who  tested  two  cordel ette  setups  (hand  tied),  one with  hi gh-t ensile  cord,  the other  with  lo w­ tech  nylon  (nylon) .  In  these  tests  the  nylon  al ways  wo n.  The  stretchy  nylon  not  only  won,  it  provided  a  much  more  dy namic  system,  something  mostly  lost on  a  cordele tte  rigged with  compar atively  static  hig h-t ensile  cord.

To most  every  trad  climb er's  relie f,  the  sliding  X  appar ently  resolved  two  lo ng-st anding  concerns:  (1 )  how  to  achie ve  maxi mum  equal ization  between  two  primar y  pi eces  of  protecti on,  and  (2)  how  to  safeguard  against  changes  in the  dir ection  of  loadi ng.  Functionally  effe ctive  within  a  wide  axis,  the  sliding  X  can  be  loaded  from  various  dir ections,  and  the  \"X\"  will  dynami­ cally  sh ift  to  help  distribute  the  force  between  two  pieces.  Rigging  th e  Sliding  X  The  sliding  X  is  simple  to  construct,  but  a  proper  twist  in the  sliding  X  sling  is  essenti al.  When  you  bungle  twis ting  the  X  into  the  sli ng, the  sliding  X  is  tota ll y  use­ less  if  one  placement  fails. To  confirm  proper  rigging  after  conn ecting  the  sliding  X  to  the  placemen ts,  simpl y  clip  a  biner  into the  X,  weight  the  placemen ts  and  slide  the  biner  back  and  forth  along the  sling  to  ensur e fl uid  and  stately  functi oning.  The  sliding  X  pr ovi des  true  automatic  equali zation;  the  drawback  is  that  it  can  allo w  ext ension in  the  system  if  the  slin gs  are  long  and  one  of  the  anchor s  fa ils.  To  mini mize  the  potential  ext ension  in  longer  slings,  tie  an  over hand  \"limi ter\"  knot  in  the  long  leg  of  the  sling ,  just  above  the  tie-in  point.  (Keep  in  mind that  this  lim iter  knot,  while  it  reduces  the pos sibil ity  for  ext ension,  also  by  its  very  nature  limi ts  the  equal izati on  properties  of the  sliding  X.)  Mak e  sur e  the  angle  between the  two  legs  of the  sling  is  not  too  large.  If  the  angle  is  lar ger  than about 45  degrees,  use  a  15 8  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nlonger  sling  to  decrease  the  angle  and  avoid load  multiplica­ tion.  An  angle  of  about  25  degr ees,  as  shown  in  the  slidin g  X  drawing,  works  well.  While  it's  an  ingenious,  simple  and  ef fective  rigging  method,  the  main  concern  is  that  the  sliding  X  violat es  the  No  Ext ension  criteria  of  SRENE.  Put  simp ly,  the  sliding  X  is  used  to  conne ct  two  pr imar y  placemen ts.  If  one  of  the  two  pri­ mary  anch ors  should  blow  when  loaded,  the  force would  \"extend\"  or  dr op  onto the  re maining  place­ ment  equid istant  to  the  slack  in  the  sl ing.  The  concern  is  that  the  force  dumping  onto  the  second  pi ece  mig ht  possibly produce  cascade  zippering  of the  remain­ ing  pi eces  of  the  anchor .  The  pos­ sibi lity  of this has  alw ays  re ma ined  a  black  mark  against  the  sli ding  X,  but Craig  Connally  (a long  with  recent testing)  lar gely  dispr oved  the  prev aili ng  paranoia  about  the  minimal  ex tension  (with  the  limi ter  knots)  pos sibili ­ ties  with  the  sliding  X.  Basically  Connally  explains  that  true  shock  loading  cannot  occu r.  Mi rr oring  recent  tes ting  done  by  Duane  Raleigh  at  Rock  &  Ice  magazine,  he  provides  the  ex ample  of  a  climber  who  clips  to  an  anc hor  with  a  Sp ectra  dais y  chain,  climb s a  few  feet  past  the  anchor ,  then  falls.

But in the case  of  moder ate  extension  fo und  in the  fa iled  arm  of  a  sliding  X  anchor ,  the  aforementi oned  shock  loadin g  does  not occur  if  ther e's  dynamic  rope in  the  syste m.  An  ex ample  would  be  to  picture  a  climb er  hanging  on  1 0  feet  of  rope.  A  placement  blo ws  and drops  him  a  foot.  Disas ter?  Unlik ely ,  since that amoun ts  to  a  fa ll  factor  0.1 ,  which  is  less  than  the  average  of  around  0.3  for  most  climb ing  fa lls.  Granted,  you  avoid  building  anchor s  that  cou ld  result  in  really  long  ex tension,  but  there's  li ttle  cause  to  fear  ordinary  setups.

To  mimm1ze  potenti al  ext ension  in  longer  equ;;lizmg  s:ings,  t1e  an  over hand  hm1ter  knot  in  the  long  leg  of  the  sling,  just  above  the  t1e-m  p01nt.  To  avoid  load  multiplication,  keep  the  angle  bet:w een  the  two legs  awund  25  degrees  (or  less) .  If  the  angle  1s  larger  than  about  45  degrees,  use  a  longer  sling  to  decrease  the  angle .  Sliding X:  Normal  Usage  Let's  look  closely  at  how  the  sliding  X  is  normally  engaged  and  dr aw  some  rules  of  thumb  for  gener al  usage.  With solid,  two-b olt  anchor s  on  mul ti  pitch  spor t  climb s  (where  the  issue  of  exte nsion  is  dim inished  and  the scale tips  toward  equal ization  or  redundanc y),  setup  is  quick  and easy.  Plus,  the  sliding  X  saves having  to  leave  two  draws  at  the  anch or.  And  for  anchor s  placed in  non-hor izontal  orientations -say,  two  cams  in  a  slanting  crack -the  sliding  X  can  conn ect  the  pair  so  they  are  largely  equalized  while  provi ding  vastly  mor e  mul tidir ect ional  capa cities  than  if  you  were  to  tie  the  same two  pieces  together  with  either  a  cordel ette  or with knots  tensioned  in  a  sli ng.  In  fact,  whenever  you  wish  to  dynamically  dis tribute  the  load  between two  pieces,  the  sliding  X  is  both  effe ctive  and  the  best-known  method.  16 0  CLIM BIN G  ANCHORS  \nA  :ilidfng  X  conn ecting  two  bolt� .

Likewise  when  arranging  pr otection  before  a  traverse,  or  after  a  tra­ verse,  when the  route  goes  abruptly  up,  the  sliding  X  is  a  blessing,  equalizing  mar­ ginal  pieces  so  they  reinf orce  each  other  across  a  mu lt idir ecti onal  ra nge.  The  pos sibili ty of  exten sion  (small with  limi ter  knots)  her e  is  eclipsed  for  ease of  setup  when  out  on  the  sharp  end.  A  leader  will  also find the  sliding  X  useful  as  a  power  poin t  on  mul tipitch  routes.  For  in sta nce,  at  the  end  of  a  lead,  if  you  gain  a  ledge  and  ne e d  to  move  around,  the  sliding  X  will  alw ays  keep tension  on  the  anchor  and  reta in  equali zat ion.  Occasionally  the  \"X\"  in  the  configuration  can  bind  on  itself  (the  so-ca lled  \"clutch  ef fect\" ).

With  poor  (i.e.,  weak)  plac ements,  the  concern  is  that  a  fa ll  could  blo w  out  the  anchor  poin t, so  equal ization  becomes  a  prio rity.  The  aim  is  to  reduce  the  ini tial  loading  on  the  stacked  (doubled up), weak  placem ents  by  di stributing the load  as  equally  as  possible  over both pieces.  Here,  exten sion  is  of  less  concern  than  maxi­ miz ing  the  potential  holdin g  strength  of  the  anchor point  to  the  extent  that  it  will  actually  hold.  Clea rly  two  sketchy  placem ents  are  better  than  one.  And  since  the  sliding  X  is the  best  thing  going  for equalizing  two  place ment s- especially  with  the  use of  lim iter kn ots-it  remains  for  many  the  strategy of  choice  when  rigging  together  stacked,  sketchy  placemen ts.

As  w1th  all  anchor  build ­ ing,  confidence  and  etfi ci�I'IC:Y  comes  w1th  pract1ce  and  Appr oximate  Equali zation  with No  Ext ension.  For  those  less  concerned  about  ext ension,  it's  better  to  dynamically  equalize  the load on the  gear  (using  the  sliding  X)  in  an  effo rt  to  pr event  failur e  than  to  anticipa te  fa il ure  and  mi tiga te  the  conse­ quence  of  ext ensi on.  Using  limi ter  knots to  minimi ze  ex tension  in  a  sliding  X  is  a  solution  that  could  possibly  appease  both  camps,  but  as  yet,  it  has  not.  Ch anges  in  th e  Direction  of  Pull  Although  this  was  covered  in  earlier  chap ters,  it's worth  repeating:  Every  clim ber  having  to hand  build  a  belay  anchor  on  a  route  that  traverses  left  or  right  dir ectly  off the belay  faces  a  particula rly  ch al lenging  situation.  Pitons,  fixed  pin s  and (to  a  lesser  degree)  SLCDs  are  all  mul tidir ec ti onal,  but every thing  else  is  unidir ecti onal,  so  any  mul ti dir ectional  capacities  must  be  pr ovi ded  by  the rigging.  Consider ,  for  ex amp le,  a  belay  anchor  where  the  leader  traverses  1 0  feet  right,  plac es  a  nut  and  fa lls.  Pro viding  the  pr otection  holds, the  dir ection  of pull will  come  BE LA Y  ANCH ORS  16 5  \ndir ectly from  the  right.  If  the  pr otection  fa il s,  or  if  the  leader  fa lls  before  placing  the  ini tial  pr o,  the  dir ection  of  pull will  describe  an  arc.  Much  of  the  load  comes  when  the  leade r's  str aigh t-down  fall  begins  to  be  pulled  into  the  arc,  and  it  continues  until  he  is  in  the  fa ll line.  Her e  the  challe nge  is  to  build  an anchor  that  will  safeguard  dead  lateral  pull ,  the  arc  of  the  swing  and  the  str aight  down  load ing  once  the  lead er's  full  weight  slams  onto  the  end  of  the  rope.  A st atically  equalized  anchor  can  only cover this  90-d egree  arc  at  various  poin ts.  At  best  the  load  will  fa ll  variously  onto  individual  placem ents  as the  climber  swings  through  the arc.  A  dynamically  equali zed  anchor  lik e  the  sliding  X- alo ne,  or  as  a  component  within  a  larger  anchor  matrix -can  cover  the  entir e  arc  insofar as the  X  slides  as  the  vectors  change.  THE  EQU ALETTE  The  equale tte  was  born  out  of  lab  tests  conduc ted  by  Jim  Ew ing  at  Ste rling  Ropes.  The  system  was  rigorously  field  tested  by  profess ional  guides  Bob  Gaines,  To m  Cecil  and  others,  who reported  very  favor able  results.  While  only  time  can  render  the  verdict  on  a  rigging  syste m,  the  equale tte  and  quad  (ex plained  shor tly)  per­ formed  wel l  in  both the  lab  tests  and in  the  field,  and  they  are  worth  consider ation  as  primar y  rigging  tools.  16 6  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  This  dllse  up  of  an  equal ette  p0wer  point  (tied  usmg  slinRs  rather  than  cord)  clearl\\7  shows  how  tu  ng  two  locking  biner s  through  thE\" :  str ands  between  th E:'  limi ter  kno ts  The  bel ayer  1s  tied  into  the  power  point  With  a  fig­ ure  eight  knot  This  set  up  will  re main  equali zed  if  the  load  swings  right  or  left,  but  if  one  anchc.r  should  fall,  the  limi ter  knots  will  mm1mi ze  e)(tension  1n  the  syo;tem .  \nThree-ptece  anchor  rig<;Jed  with  an  equale tte .

After  the  cord  is con­ nected  with  a  double  fisherman's  knot,  the  loop  is then  formed  into  a U  shape.  At  the  bottom  of  the  U,  two  limi ter  knots  are  tied  appr oximately  10  inches  apar t,  with  the  fisherman's  knot  situated just  above  one  of  the  li miter  kno ts. This keeps the  fisherman' s  knot  clear  of  the  two-stra nd  arms  of  the  equale tte  that  are  used  to  tie  off  primar y  placements.  For  speed  and efficiency  the  lim iter  knots  are  best  le ft  tied  in to  the  sling  between  usage.  BE LAY  ANCHOR S  16 7  \nFour -ptece  eq•Jal ette  rig .

Adjust the  str ands  so  your  knots  end  up  evenly  tensioned  (cl ove  hitches  are  very  helpful  there,  if  not  re quir ed).  For  a  two -placement  setup,  conn ect  each  arm  of  the  equale tte  to  the  place­ ments  via  the  loops  in the  cord,  clo ve  hi tches  or  overh and  knots on  a  bight.  For  three  placemen ts,  one  arm  will  accommoda te  two  placeme nts  (usually  with  clove  hitches  tied  into  individual  stra nds  of  the  arms),  and  the other  arm  will  conn ect  to  one  plac ement  (via the  loop  in the  cord,  a  cl ove  hitch  or  overh and  on  a  bight).  For  conn ecting  four  plac ements,  each  strand  (fo ur  total)  of  the two  arms  will  conn ect  the  placem ents  via the  loop  in the  cord,  clove  hi tches. Be  sur e  the  load-bearing  str ands alig n  with  the  spine  of  the  bin er.  The  equal ette  can  also be  rigged  using  a  double -leng th  sling ,  though  you'll  find  the  7mm  cordel ette  easier  and mor e  versat ile  to  work  with,  especially  when  tying  clove  hi tches.  Plus  you  have  the  added  ben efit  of  the  stretch  in  the  nylon  cord  to  reduce peak  loading  on  the  anchor  syste m.  Te sts  show  that the  equale tte  allo ws  nearly  per fect  equali zation  between  the  two  arms,  and  it  allo ws  a  ratio  of  equali zati on  between  both  str ands  on  each  arm.  While  it is  impossible  (in  a  practical  sense)  to  achie ve per fect  equali zation  between  all  four  plac ements,  the  equale tte  achie ves  a  degree  of  equal izatio n-a long  with  solid  redunda ncy  and very  inconsequential  ext ensio n-to  a  higher  degr ee  than  any  system  tested.  BE LAY  ANCH ORS  16 9  \nBecause  the  power  point  biner s can  slip  side  to  side  on  the  str ands  between  the  li miter  knots,  the  system,  when  weighted,  will  dynamically  equalize  to  accom­ modate  a  limi ted  degree  of  off -axis  loading.  In  those  rare  cases  wher e  ho rizontal  forces  can  imp act  the  bel ay,  oppositional  anchor s  are  needed.  As  with  any new rigging  system,  it  takes  a  few  times  working  through  a  vari ety  of  anchor s  before  you  can rig the  equale tte  qu ickly  and  effi cie ntly.  The  ha rdest  par t  of the  system  is  getti ng  used  to  feath ering  the  knots to  achie ve  equal  tension  in the  arms  and/or  str ands.  But this  is  mastered  qui ckly,  making  the  equal ette  as  fast  to  rig  as the  cordele tte.  And  because  you  don't  use  as  many  knots  with  the  equale tte,  breaking  down  the  system  is  much  faster  than  breaking  down a  cordel ette.  Ad vantages  of  th e  Equalette  •  It  provides  vastly  superior  equal izati on  over the  cordele tte.  •  If  you  pull  considerably  off -axis  on  an  equale tte,  two  arms  remain  equalized.

Limitat ions  of  the  Equalette  No  rigging  method  is  without  its  lim itations,  and  one  size,  or  one  syste m,  does  not  fit  all  circums tances.  In itial  experiences  suggest that  the  equale tte  is  quite  versati le  and  user  friend ly,  but  several  things  should  be  kept  in  mind. While  the  two  arms  of  the  equal ette  achie ve  a  remark able  degree  of  equal izat ion,  the  equal ization  between  the  ind ividual  str ands  is  less  than  the  al most  per fect  equali zation  between the  arms  when  the  system  is  rigged  to  three  or  four  plac ements.  Also,  too  many  cl ove  hitches  tied  into  small-dia meter  cord  can  twist  the  rope,  so  con­ sider  using  a  combination  of  knots  when  rigging  three  or mor e  pl acem ents.

The  quad  is  best  rigged with 5.5mm  hig h-t ensile  cord  (for  durabi lity  and  com­ pactness ).  Fir st,  form  a  loop by  connec ting  a  20-foot  piece  of  hig h-t ensile  cord  with  a  triple  fishe rman's  knot.  Double  that  loop  and  form  the  doubled  loop  into  a  U.

COMPOSITE  ANCHORS:  CORDELEnE,  SLIDING  X  AND  EQUALETTE  Before  the  Sterling  Ropes  tests  (described  later  in  this  chap ter),  which  redefi ned  our use  of  the  tr aditional  cord ele tte  rigging  system,  many clim bers  belie ved  that  the  sliding  X  was best  consid ered  as  a  component  and  that  the  cordele tte  was  the  Whole Ball  Game.  In  any  event,  because  it  is  fast and  req uir es  nothing  beyond  a  sling , the  slidin g X  is  the  most  eff icient  and  flexible  method  of  com binin g  two  pri­ mary  placemen ts  to  a  cordele tte,  or  better yet,  an  equale tte.  17 2  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nIn the  traver sing  scenario  mentioned  ea rlier , a  cordele tte  or  knotted  sling s  wou ld  be  orien ted for  a  vertical/down­ ward  pull.  As  has  been shown,  ho rizon­ tal  loading  wo uld  variously  fa ll  on  single  placemen ts,  intr oducing  greater  load­ ing /cascade  fa ilur e  potent ial.  In  the  past  it  was  here  that  we  mig ht  have  com­ bined  a  sliding  X  with  a  cordele tte  so  that  if  the  leader  fe ll  from  abo ve  the  belay  with  no  gear  in,  the whole  anchor  was  equali zed  fo r a  downward  pull,  but  if  the  leader  fell  on  the  traverse,  the  two  pieces  conn ected  by  the  sliding  X  would  shar e  the  load.  Now  it  seems  that we  have even  mor e  options,  including  an  equale tte,  or an  equale tte  combined  with  a  sliding  X,  the  latter  configur ation  shorn  up  with  one or  more  oppo sition- a  is  set for  upward  forces,  thus  forming  a  super  mul tidir ectional  anchor . Wh atever  system or  combination  you  choose,  safeg uarding  the  fu ll  range  of  the  arc  is  the  goal.  Another  common  com po sit e-a nchor  situation  occur s  when  a  cordele tte  or  Multi-pi tch  anchor  With  c.orclele tte  and  slidmg  X  combo  While  th1s  setup­ and  ones  hke  1t-have been  a  mains tay  for  manv  years.  mcor poratmg  new  techr o1ques  such  as  �he  equa lette  will  allo w  cli mbers  to  ach1 eve  even  greater  equ<!l i zation .  equa let te  isn't  long  enough  to  equali ze  thr ee  pieces  and  remain  pointed  in  the  anticipa ted  dir ection  of  pull.  To  fix  this,  simp ly  equal ize  two  of  the  pi eces with  a  sliding  X,  then  rig  this  with  the  cordele tte  or  equale tte  to  the  third  piece.  In this  si t­ uation  it  makes  sense  to  use  an  equale tte  in  place  of  a  cordele tte  to  ach ieve  supe- rior  equali zati on.  WHAT'S  BEST  FOR  BEGIN NERS?  What,  by  and  lar ge,  is  the  most  appr opri ate  system  for  begin ner s?  Every  in structor  knows  that  beginn ers  are  sur e  to  place  sketchy  gear  (pr imar y  placem ents)  and  mis­ judg e  the  dir ection  of  pull.  For  this  reason  we  suggest  a  se lf-eq uali zing  system  that  will  adapt  to  changes  in load  dir ection  and  that  will  exploit  the  coll ective  stre ng th  of  less than  textb ook  plac ements.  BELA Y  ANCH ORS  17 3  \nSRENE  Anchor s  Solid  Redunda nt  Equal ized  No  extension  Guide  To m  Cecil says,  \"It  is  mor e  pr otective  to  teach  se lf- equali zation  to  beginners.  Using  self - equal ization  as  a  strategy  is  lik e  using  tr aining  wheels  on  a  bike.  They  allo w  the  beginner  to  lean  in any  dir ection  and  still  be  held.  Over  time  they  learn  to  anticipate  these  forces .\"  Bob  Gaines,  co-a uthor  and  owner  of  Vertical  Adven­ tures  guide  service,  sees it  this  way:  \"The  key  in teach- ing novices  is  to  stress  the  absolu te  imp ortance  of  av oiding  factor  2  fa ll  situations.  They  must  be  taught  to  recognize  the  forces  and  place  pro  (the  Jesus  Nut) soon  and  often  abo ve  a  bel ay.  This  help s  ensur e  that the  peak  forces  that  novices  encounter  will  occur  at  the  hig hest  piece  of  pro,  not  at the  anchor .  In  most  situations,  when  bel ayers  are  cat ching  a  leader  fa ll,  it  is  a  good  thing  if  the  force  gener ated  by  the  fa lling  leader  is  great  enough  to  pull  the  bela yer  sligh tly  upward,  as the  coun terwe ight  effe ct  greatly  reduces  the  force  on  the  piece  the  leader  has  fa llen  on.  Th erefore,  the best  belay  strategy  is to  be  anchored  against  the  upward  pull  with  a  bit  of  slack  in  the  system,  which  provides  some  count erbalance  shoc k- absor bing,  but  not  so  much  so  that  the  be/oyer  is  pumm eled  into  the  wall  or  extruded  through  the  Jesus  Nut.  \"As  far  as  toprope  setups  go,  the  dir ection  of  pull  is  basically  stra ight  down­ easy  to  ju dge  even  by  the  novice.  The  biggest  and  most  common  mis take  I  see  with  novice  rigger s  (aside  fro m  poor  primar y  placeme nts)  is  usually  major  exten­ sion  potential  and lack  of  redunda ncy.\"  UPWARD  OPPO SITIONAL  ANCHORS  As  shown  in  various  pho tos,  for  an  anchor  to  susta in  upward  loading,  we  often  place  a  nut or  cam  set for  an  upward  pull,  below  and  in  opposi tion  to  the  other  pri­ mary  placem ents  in  the  anchor  matrix.  While  upward  forces  at  a  belay  are  gener ­ all y  small  compar ed  to  downward forces, I've  repeatedly  seen this  oper a  play  out  in the gym: A  bela yer  is  grossly  outweighed  by  some  lug  climbing  on  a  toprope.  From  neglect  or  sloth  the  svelte  belayer  has  for egone  a  ground  anchor .  Jumbo  pitches  off  and  the  belayer is  dir ectly  wrenched  5  to  20  feet  into  the  air .  I'v e  wit­ nessed  bela yers  hoisted  ali  the  way  to  the  top  anchor ,  30  feet  up.  Jumbo,  who  is  now  on  the  ground, acts  as  a  cou nter we ig ht/a nchor ,  and  the  belayer  returns  to  the  deck  by  ra ppelling  down  the  rope  via  th eir  belay  device,  through  which the  rope  runs.  This  scenario  is  part icular  to  the  gym,  where  the  routes  are  vertical  to  over­ hanging  and  the  top  rope  usually  runs  over  a  chubby  pipe  on the top  of  the  route.  On  a  cl iff  the  rope  runs  through  carabiners,  at  ra dicall y  tighter  angles  that  won't  al low  such  a  meteoric  hois t  as  found  in  the  gym fiasco.  Ne verth eless,  this  17 4  CLIMBING  ANC HOR S  \nextrava gant  hoisting  of  the  belayer  of ten  took  pl ace  during  drop  tests  conduc ted  by  the  Sie rra  Club  and  other outfits  during  the  19 60s and early  19 70s.  In  the  Sier ra  Club  ver sion,  one  end  of  some  goldlin e  rope  was  atta ched  to  a  buck et  of  concr ete  weighing  roughly  12 0  pounds.  The  ro pe  ra n up an  over hanging  wall to  an  anchor  on  top-or  was  conn ected to  a  cross-beam  in  a  gy mnasium,  as  the  case may have  been -t hen  back  down to  a  bela yer  on the  gr ound.  By  means  of  another  line,  the  bu cket  was  heaved  1 0  to  20  feet  into  the  air -acco rd ing  to the  sadis tic  leanings  of  the  in structor -th en  cut  loose,  leaving  the  bela yer  to  ar rest  the  1  0-to 20-foot  \"f all\"  via  a  hip  bel ay.  Mor e  than  one  corn-fed  male  was  launched  as if  shot  from  a  catapult,  and  it  was even  mone y  that  a  wispy  female  could  get  extruded  half way  through  the  anchor  biner .  Such  was  the  exa min ation  to  become  a  certified  rock  climber  in  year s  past.  The  tub by/svelte  toprope  hoist  job  and  the  antique  drop  test  are  goof ball  exam­ ples  but  nonetheless  demon strate  the  power  of  upward forces,  and  the  need  to  safeguard  against  them  if  and  when  they  are  sig nificant  factors.  The  question  is:  What are  the  circumstances  in  which  up ward forces  are  great  enough  to  warrant  oppositional  placemen ts  in  the belay  anchor ?  Let's  place  our selves  back  on  the  rock  and  see  what  qu estions  arise.  Consider  a  lea der  cli mbing  abo ve  a  hanging  bel ay.  If  she  fa lls  off  and  is  ar rested  by the  Jesus  Nut,  for  ins tance,  or  pro  she  has  placed  higher , the  belayer  will  be  pulled  upward,  or  dir ectly  toward the first  piece  of  pr otection  off  the  bel ay- which  is  generally  upward  sinc e  most  climbs  go  up.  But  what  is the  actual  power  of  this  upward  force  on  a  bel ayer?  Most  of  us  have held  leader  falls  that  have  jerked  us  skyward  hard and  fast,  but  even  on  steep  sport  routes,  if the belayer and  the  leader  weigh  roughly  the  same,  when have  you  ever  seen  a  bel ayer,  following  a  leader  fa ll,  left  in  midair , stret ched  taut  against  an  anchor  str aining  ag ains t the  upward  force?  UP WA RD FORCE  OPPOSITIONAL S  ARE  RE QUIR ED:  When  a  belayer  1s  si gnificantly  lig hter  than  the  active  climber  WhenE'ver  belaying  below  an  overhang  and  the  initial  protectton  off  the  belay  anchor  (the  Jesus  Nu t)  1s di rectly  ab ove  or  P.ven  behmd  (such  as  w1th  a  roof  crack)  the  anchor  Where  the  rock  is steep  or  overhd ngmg and  the  forces  gener ated  by a  leader  fall  can  create  stgntfi t:: ant  (sdy,  mor e  than  18  inches)  ''lift\"  Ctf  the  belayer  BELA Y  ANCHOR S  17 5  \nTh1s  rig  shows  a  carde latte  used  to  equal­ Ize  the  load  '>n  two tapers  With  anoth�r  SLCD  plac. ed  to  prov1de  opposition .

Consequen tly,  in real  world  climbi ng,  nuts  placed  in  oppo sition  to  safeguard  against  upward  forces  are  never  expec ted  to  sust ain  the  same  loading  as  those  placed  for  downward  forces.  In  fact  one  of  the  ongoing  debates  in  the  climbing  communi ty  is  whether  or  not  upward-oppositional  pl acem ents  are  necessar y  at  all.  Some  people  favor  forgo ing  upward  force  opposi­ tionals because they  think  opposi­ tion  a  Is  waste  time,  ener gy  and  gear  while  \"needle ssly\"  comp licating  the  syste m.  Propon ents  of  oppositional  anchor s  raise  the poss ibi lity  of the  anchor  being  upr ooted  when  the  bela yer  is  dragged  up ward  in  the cour se  of  holdin g a  fa ll.  For this  to  ever  hap pen,  the  bela y  anchor  wo uld  have  to  be  set  in  vertical  cracks  and  consist  of  nuts  and,  less  lik e ly,  cams-pro  that  might  con­ ceivably  be  pluck ed  clean  if the  bela yer  were  yanked  a  suf f icient  dis­ tance  above  the  anch or .  I've  never  read  of  an  instance  wher e a  be  layer  actually  got  dr agged  above  the  anchor  and  where  the  primar y  placeme nts  in  the  belay  anchor  itself were  pluck ed  from  the  crack  like  cl oves  from  a  holi day  ham.  We  know that  during  a  leader  fa ll  (held  by pro  abo ve  the  belay),  sl ight  lif t  of  the  bel ayer's  body and flex  and  give  in  the  system  act  as  peak  force  reducer s,  absorb­ ing much  of  the  fall's  kinetic  ener gy  before  the  anc hor  is  ever  loaded.  If  nothing  else,  rope  sli p/stretch  will  lik ely  preclude  a  meteoric  hoist,  even  when  little  rope is  out.  But  that 's  with  a  bela yer  who  weighs  ro ughly  the  same  as  the  leader .  Get  a  leader  who  weighs  twice  as  much  as  the  bel ayer,  and  the  lif t factor  becomes  sign if­ icant  no  mat ter  the  angle.  Here  the  peak  force  reduction  enjoyed  by  the  body  of  a  lar ge  climber  is  null  and  void.  And  so  is the  main  argument  against  setti ng  nu ts  for  an  upward  pull:  No matter  the  fa ll  scenario,  the  belayer  is  not  lik ely  to  be  li fted  far  17 6  CL IMBING  ANCHOR S  \nenough  to  threaten  the  anchor .  My counter  to  this  claim  is  that  I  (21 0  pounds)  once  fell  at  Ta hqu itz  and  pull ed  bel ayer  Lynn  Hill  (1  05  pounds)  10  feet  in to  the  air .  When  Opp ositionals  Are  Required  While  there are  instanc es-p rimarily  on  low-angled  clim bs-that  clim ber s  can  argue  against  setti ng  nu ts  to  safeguard  against  up ward  pull,  there  are  other  instances  wher e  upward  oppositionals  are  compulsor y.  These  include  A)  steep  hanging  bela ys  built from  hand-placed  gear ,  B)  whene ver  you are  belaying  belo w  an  overh ang  and  the  ini tial  protection  off  the  belay  anchor  (J esus  Nut)  is  dir ectly  abo ve  or  even  behind  (such  as  with  a  roof  crack)  the  anchor ,  and  C)  when  a  be  layer  is  sign ificantly  lig hter  than  the  active  climb er.  All  three  of  these  examples  are  where  the  rock  is  near ,  at  or  past  vert ica l,  wher e a  fa lling  climber  will  basically  be  air borne  and where  forces  gener ated  by  a  leader  fa ll  are  great  enough  to  start  replicating  the  mega-hoist  seen in  our  fi rst  two  exampl es-the  toprope  scenario  in  the  gym  and in the  Sie rra  Club  drop  test.  Bottom  line:  Some  li ttle  \"l ift\"  at  the belay  is  usually  a  good  thing,  acting  as  a  coun terwe ight  and  load  limi ter  to  the forces  gener ated  by a  leader  fa lli ng  above.  But  whene ver  the  potential  of  that  lif t  exceeds  a  foot  or  so  (the  A,  B  and  C  in our  examples  abo ve) ,  oppositional  placem ents  should  alw ays  be  incorpor ated  into  the  belay  anchor .  BELA Y  POSI TIONS  No  matter  what  system  you  use  to  conne ct  your  primar y  place ments  to  a  power  point,  the  tec hni ques  used  to  arrange  various  types  of  bela ys  (dir ect,  sem i-d ir ect  and  re-di rected)  remain  much  the  same.

To  answer  the fundamental  questions  raised  in  that  discussion,  we  needed  to  gen erate  some  har d  data.  The  aim  of  tes ting  was  to  determ ine  performance  dif ferences  between  the  slidin g X  and the  cordele tte  when  both  systems  were  subjec ted  to  the  same  dyna mic  load  (as  found  in  a  real  world  fa ll) .  Since  hundr eds  of  thousands  of  clim ber s  literally  hang  their  li ves  off  these  syste ms  on  a  weekly  basis,  such  testing  was  clearly  ind ispensable  to  both  this  manual  and  the  climbing  community  at  lar ge.  On  the  recommendation  of  Kolin  Powick,  qua lity  assurance  manager  at  Black  Diamond,  the  physical  testing  was  conduc ted  by  Jim  Ewing,  research  and  develop­ ment  manager  at  St erling  Ropes.  Ewing  is  both  a  world-class  climb er  and  an  engi­ neer  with  years  of  experience  testing  on Sterling's  UIM  drop towers and  computer  assist  gear ,  and  he  is  widely  considered  the  leading  tester  in  the  Uni ted  States.  The  tests  took  weeks  and  many  late  nights  to  com ple te  (upwards  of  200  drop  tests  were  per fo rmed)  and  went  far  in  answering  many  long -st anding  questions about  riggi ng  sys tems.  Very  much  an  ongoing  team  ef fort,  Ewing's  raw  data  was  worked  up  by  nat iona lly  recognized  statis tical  exper ts  (and  climb ers)  Dr.  Lawrence  Hamil ton  and  Dr .  Calli e  Rennison.  Last ly,  the  tests  led  to  a  di scovery  phase  involving  several  new  rigging  stra tegies  that were  field  tested  and  refi ned  by  profess ional  guides  Bob  Gaines  and  To m  Cecil  and  others.  Te st  Par ame ters  In  order  to  devise  the  most  signi ficant  tests,  we  fi rst  had  to  determine  what  factors  were  most  crucial  to  a  team  buil ding  and  belaying  off  a  real  world  anchor .  This  involv ed  ex amining  the  fo llowing  eleme nts  of  the  anchor  chain.  1)  The  prim ary  pl acements.  Hundr eds  of such  tests  alr eady  exist  on  the  strength of  \"this\"  bolt  and  \"that\"  camming  device.  Further  anal yses  could  te ll  us  li t­ tle  about  the  appl ied  function  of  either  the  sli ding  X  or  the  cordele tte.  2)  The  conn ecting  points.  In  other  words,  the  bin ers  that  connect  the  cor dele tte  and the  slid ing  X  to  both  the  primary  anchor  placem ents  and  the  power  point.  Again,  we  ini tially  belie ved  such  testi ng  wo uld  divulge  little  about  per form­ ance  dif f erences  per  either  rigging  system-a  belief  we  later  revised.  3)  Mater ials.  Because  pr evious  testi ng  indi cated  performance  di fferences  between  old- style  nylon and  hi gh-t ensil e-strength  cord and  webbing  (Dyneema,  Spec tra,  etc.).  we  decided  to  use  a  variety  of  commonl y  used  materials  for  all  testing.  BE LAY  ANCHOR S  18 3  \n4)  Knots.  Te sts  have  shown  the  holding  power  of  hi gh-te nsile  cord  is  reduced  once  it  is  knotted  (less  so in  nylon).  Ho wever  there  is  little  if  any  real world evi­ dence  to  su ggest  that  the  holding  strength  of  a  use-appr opr iate,  properly tied  knot -tied  in  any  materia l-has  ever  caused  anchor  fa ilur e.  Hence  the  issue  of  knots  and  knot  strength  was  ruled out as  being  relevant  to  our  testing.  5)  Exte nsion.  Not  an  issue  with  the  cordel ette.  And  with  limi ter  knots  (alw ays  advised),  the  exte nsion  possibil ities  of  the  sliding  X  are  reduced  to  mer e  inches.  As  Cr aig  Connall y  has  shown,  pro vid ing  ther e  is  flex  and  give  in  the  system-as  there  normall y  is  in  a  real  world  belay  and  a  real  world  leader  fal l-it  seemed  unlik ely  that  ext ension  of  mer e  inches  can  ever  cause the  \"shock  loadi ng\"  we  so  frequently  read  about.  While  the  limi ted  ext ension  (as  found  in  a  sliding  X  with  limi ter  knots)  was  con­ sid ered  a  minor  factor  in  dete rmining  performance  di ffe rences  between  rigging  systems,  we  had  no  lab  data  to  determ ine  the  forces  involved  during this  exten­ sion.  Wrestl ing  with  this  lo ng-st anding  question,  Jim  conduc ted  a  battery  of  tests  that  stro ngly  suggest  shor t  ext ension does  not  cause  any  in crease  in  forces  (load  mul tiplic ation)  beyond  the  initial  load  on  the  system  prior  to  the  fa ilur e  of  one  pri­ mary  anchor  placement.  This  is  a  fasc inating,  involved  and  impor tant  sub ject  that  warrants  further  resear ch.  6)  Redundanc y.  In  terms of  a  belay  anch or,  a red undant anchor  is  di fferent  than  an  anchor  that  is  mer ely  backed  up.  A  redundant  belay  anchor  implies  that  the  forces  gener ated  in  a  leader  fa ll  will  never  fall  on  one  piece  of  gear .  With  a  backed  up  anchor ,  the  force  fa lls  on  a  single  primar y  anchor  placement,  and  if  that  fa ils,  the  force  then falls  on  a  second  placement,  and if  that  fa ils,  the  force  impac ts  a th ir d  placeme nt-the  dreaded  \"cascade\"  anchor  fa ilur e.  To  avoid  this  cascade  scenario  and  to  enjoy  functional  redundancy  in  a  belay  anchor  (to  avoid  loading  on  one piece  of  gear),  impac t  forces  must  be  spread  or  equalized  over  at  least  two  primar y  place­ ments.  To  determine  how  well  any  rigging  system  accomplishes  such  functi onal  redundanc y  would  ther efore  involve the  issue  of  equali zati on.  7)  Equal izati on.  Equal izati on  is  the  very  qual ity  for  which  the  sliding  X  and  the  cor dele tte  wer e  designed,  and  are  emp loyed,  to  achie ve.  After  the  previous  an aly­ sis  it  became  clear  that  the  most  meani ngful  testi ng  wo uld  determine  how well or  how  poor ly the  sliding  X  (dy namically  equal ized  system)  and  the  cordele tte  (stati­ cally  equali zed  system)  del ivered  on  their  promise  of  equalization.  To  cont rast  the  functional  equali zation  of  the  sliding  X  and  the  cordel ette,  we  decided  on the  following  test  parameters:  •  \"Slow  pull,\"  static  loading  tests  have  limit ed  bearing  on  real  world  spor t  and  adventure  climbing.  Only drop  tests,  using  actual  climbing  rope,  could  replic ate  the  dynamic  forces  of  a  real  world  leader  fa ll.  18 4  CLIMBING  ANCHO RS  \n•  A  drop  test  equaling  a  real  world  factor  1  fa ll  wo uld  be  used  during  each  and  every  test.  Factor  1  forces  represent  a  sig nificant  but  ·  not  shattering  fa ll.  Such  forces  would  plainly  illus trate  how  well  both  the  sliding  X  and  the  cordele tte  distributed  the  dynamic  load (in  our  case)  over  two  primar y  place ments  of  an  anchor .  It  is  almo st certa in  that  a greater  or  lesser  dynamic  force  (th an  that  of  a  factor  1  fa ll)  would  not  change  the  actual  load­ Metric  Conver sion  Chart  1  mm  0  039  iriCh  1  em  0.393  Inch  1  dm  3  937  inch  1 m  39.37  mch  3.28  f  et  1  kg  1  kN  2  2046  pounds  220  pounds  sharing  rati os,  and  that from  the  ratios  pr o vided  by  the  factor  1  tests,  we  could  reliably  extr apola te  up  or  down.  The  test  rigging  was set  up  as follo ws:  1.  Pie ces  of  cord  and  webbing  tied  in  14 0cm to  15 0cm  loops  were  used as  opposed  to  the  mor e  typical 600cm.  This  length of cord was used to  simpli fy  setup.  2.  The  dynamic  load  (\"mass\")  was  dropped  on  1  0.2mm  Sterl ing  Kosmos  lead  rope.  3.  All  drops  =  fall  factor  1  on  O.Sm  of  rope  (sta rting  leng th)  between  figur e  eight  knots.  4.  Mass =  10 0  kg  Summary:  Sim ply  put,  the  first  tests  an swered  the  following  que stion:  If  we  rigged  a  cordele tte  and  a  sliding  X  off  the  same  anchor s  (in  both  verti cal  and  hori­ zontal  configurations)  and sub jected the  anchor s  to  a  contr olled,  dynamic  fall  of  exactly  the  same  leng th  and  force,  what  might  the  test  data  disclose  in  terms  of  how  well  the two  rigging  syste ms  di stributed  the forces  between  the two  anchor  poin ts?  Here  is  what  we  fo und.  These  tests  provided  two  dis tinct  pie ces  of  information  about  the  sliding  X  and  the  cordele tte  rigging  syste ms.  Fir st,  the  results  offe r  the  average  absolu te  \"d iffer­ ence  in  force\"  or  \"d iffe rence  in  load\"  between the  two  legs  of  the  anchor  gener­ ated  due  to  a  factor  1  fa ll.  In  some  cases,  these  di ffe r ences  are  close  to  zero,  mean in g  that  each  leg  of  the  anchor  receives  about  half  of the  force.  In  others,  the  di ff erences  are  quite  hi gh,  sug gesting  that  one leg  is  experiencing  a  dispr opo rtion­ ate  amount  of  the  force  gener ated.  ideally  we  would like  to  see  the  force  di strib­ uted  equally  between  the  two arms  of  the  anchor .  Second,  test  results  ind icate how  consistent  or  inconsis tent  these  measur ed  \"d iffe rences  in loa d/force\"  are  across multiple  tests.  In  some cases,  repeated  meas­ ures  will  produce  very  cons istent  res ults. In  other  cases,  great  variation  in  meas­ ureme nts  of  these  di ff erences  will  be  noted,  suggesting  that  the  di ffe rence  in  load  BE LAY  ANCHORS  18 5  \nHOR IZO NTAL  ANCHOR  SCENARIO -EQUAL  LEGS  DistancE  between  anchor  att achment  po1nts  =  30c  m  :!:  1  em  Length  of  le g s  =  70cm  :1:  1  em  Length  of  IE=gs  0'  70cm  :!:  1  em  Angle  between  legs ·\"\"  24'  Angle between  leg s  �.  24°  VER TICAL  CR ACK  SCEN AR IO-U NEQ UAL LEGS  Dis tance  l:letween  top  and  bottom  anchor  pomts  =  45cm  Length  o!

Cordel ette  equal  length:  Te sts  simulating  a  factor  1  fall  demons trate  that on  aver age,  a  cordele tte  with  equal-l ength  arms  configuration  gener ated  an  absolu te  di ff erence  in  load  that  was  almo st 1  kN  (220  pounds),  a  sig nificant  amount.  Repeated  measur ements  of  the dif ference  in  the  forces  gener ated  varied  some­ what  across  multiple  tests.  Contrary  to  conventi onal  wisdom  and  popular  usage,  the  cordele tte,  even  with  equal-leng th  arms,  is  not  a  very  effe ctive  system  to  achie ve  equali zati on.  B.  Sliding  X  equal  length:  Te sting  of  this  anchor  configur ation  sho ws  that  on  average,  the  absolu te  di ffe rence  in  force  transferred  to  each  equal -leng th  arm  due  to  a factor 1  fall  was very  close  to  zero  (i.e.,  about  0.2  kN  di ffe r ence) .  In  other  words,  on  average,  there  is  al most  no  dif ference  in load  measur ed  using  a  sliding  X  equal-leng th  rigging  configuration.  This  configuration  equal izes  very  we ll.  In  addi ­ tion,  repeated  tes ting  demo nstrates  that  the  di ffe rence  in  force  gener ated  between the arms  was  very  consistent  across  mul tiple  tests.  In  fact,  the  consis­ tency  in  equal ization  from  drop  to  drop  did  not  get  better  than  this  configur ati on.  When  comp ared  to the  cordele tte  equal rig, it  is  clear  that  the  sliding  X  equal­ leng th  performs  far  better.  Not  only  does  the  sliding  X  equal-l ength  system  equal­ ize  much  be tter  than  the  cordel ette  in  a  similar  situation,  it  equal izes  much  mor e  consi stently  from  fa ll  to  fall.  18 6  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nHow  do  these  configurations  compar e  in  a  situation  in  which  one mus t  buil d an  anchor  with  unequal-leng th  arms?  C.  Cordel ette  unequal  length:  This  clea rly-the-worst -configuration  tested  produces  an  absolute  average  di ffe r ence  in force  between  the  anchor  arms  of  al most  3. 5  kN,  or  roughly  780  pounds  of  force.  Aside  from  generating  the  lar gest  di ffe rence  in  force  of  the  riggings  measur ed,  the  cordele tte  unequa l-leng th  rigging  was  the  most  inconsis tent  when  repeated  measur es  of  this  di ffe rence  were  taken.  In  some  cases,  the  dif ference  in load  measur ed  was  greater  than  5  kN.  To  put  it  blun tly,  the cordele tte  un equal-leng th  configu ration  is the  poor est  per fo rming  anchor  consider ed  in  all  the  testi ng  cond ucted.  Not  only  is  equal ization  very  poor ,  the  de gree  of  equalization  varies  wildl y  from  fall  to  fa ll.  This  configuration  is  very  unpr edictable,  except that  the  di ffe rence  in the  forces  gener ated  from  a  fa ll  will  be  high.  The  cordele tte  une qual  leng th  is  simpl y  to  be  avoi ded.  D.  Sliding  X  unequal  length:  The  fourth  configuration  ex ami ned is  the  sliding  X  unequa l-le ngth  anch or .  This  rigging  produces,  on  average,  an  absolute  di ffe rence  in  force between  anchor  arms  of  appr oximately  1  kN  as  a  res ult  of  a  factor  1  fa ll,  putting  it  on  par  with  the equali zation  obtained  using  a  cordele tte  with  equal  arm  lengths.  Though  the  equal ization  offe red  by  the  sliding  X  unequal  is on  par  with  the  cordele tte  equa l,  both  are  inferior  to  the  sliding  X  equal.  Of the two  unequal -arm  configurations  ex amined,  ho wever ,  it  is  very clear  that  the  sliding  X  unequal  is  the  way to go.  In terms of  consistenc y  in  equal ization  from  test  to  test,  the  sliding  X  unequal­ leng th  configuration  was  as  cons istent  in  the  absolute  di ffe rences  in  load  gener ­ ated  ac ross  repeated  fa ll s.  Interesting ly,  though,  while  it  tended  to  be  very  cons istent  across  repeated  measu res,  this  anchor  was  also  the  most  lik ely  of  all  configur ations  to  produce  an  occasional  extr eme  dif fere nce  in  load.  In  other  words,  although  tests  sho wed  this  configuration  to  be  generall y  consi stent,  it  gen­ erated  some  unpr edic tably  dr eadful  equali zati on.  Su mmar y:  This  ini tial  series  of  testing  firmly  est ablishes  the  sliding  X  as  supe ­ rior  in  terms  of  load  di stribution,  while  at  the  same  time  suggesting  that  the  mate­ rials  used  played  only  a  mi nor  role.  While  the  equa l-armed  cordel ette  dis tributes  a  dynamic  load  to  an  acceptable  degree  (ba rely) , and  will  no  doubt  rem ain  a  viable  option  in  that  configuration,  a  cordele tte  rigged  with  unequal  arms  is  an  inferior ­ and  li kely  hazardous- choice  when  co ntrasted  with the more  effi cient  load  dis tri­ bution  of  the  sliding  X.  The  Sliding  X- Why  Unpredictab le?  The  sl iding  X  with  unequal  arms  showed  acceptable  but  sometimes  un predictable  loading.  While  sti ll  far  superior  to  the cordele tte  with unequal  arms,  we  wond ered  if  switching  out  a  gear  compo nent - mainl y  the  power  point  biner -might  pr oduce  BE LA Y  ANCHOR S  18 7  \nmore  equal  loadin g.  This  idea  came  from  other tests that  suggested  the X  was  prone  to  binding on  itself  (the  \"clutch  effect\" ), and  that  a  wide-mouth,  anodized  biner  co uld  greatly  reduce,  if not  elimi nate,  the  clutch  effe ct.  During  testing  Jim  Ewing  noticed  that  the  X,  or  cross ing  of  the  cord  or  webbing,  naturally wanted  to  settle  right  on  the  biner .  In  rigging the  sliding  X  for  this  round  of  tests,  he manu all y  forced  the  cross ing  to  occur  on  one  or  the  other  side  of  the  bi ner  in  order  to  avoid  the  clutching  effect  (i.e.,  separ ated  str ands).  He  also  used  an  anodized,  wide-mouth  (pear - shaped)  biner  for  this  set  series  of  drops.  To  inv esti­ gate  the role  of  the  clutch  effe ct,  additional  tests  were  conducted.  Pieces  of  cord  and  webbing  tied in  14 0cm  to  15 0cm  loops  were  used,  the  dynamic  load (1  00  kg)  was  dropped  on  1  0.2  Sterl ing  Kosmos  lead  rope  and  the drops  equaled  fall  factor  1  on O.Sm  of  rope  (star ting  leng th)  between  figure  eight  knots.  In  addi tion,  the  long  leg  equaled  1  OOcm  +1- 3cm,  the  shor t  leg  equaled 45cm  +1- 3cm  and  the  angle  between  legs  equaled  0  degrees.  Again,  during  tests,  the  str ands  of  the  anchor  were  manuall y  separ ated  on the  biner .  Her e  is  what we  fou nd.  The sliding  X  unequal  with  an  anodized wide-mouth  biner  produces, on  aver­ age,  a  di ffe rence  in force  between  anchor  arms  of  ap proximately  0.5  kN  as  a  result  of  a  factor  1  fa ll.  In other  words,  the  equalization  achie ved  using  this  configuration  is  better  than  that  achie ved  using  the  sli di ng  X  unequal  leng th  (about  1  KN), and  a  bit  worse  tha n that  obtained  for  the  sliding  X  equal  leng th  (about  0.2  kN).  Over  repeated  tests,  di ff erences  in  kN  gener ated  by  this  configur ation  varied  at  about  the  same  degree  produced  by  the  sli ding  X  equal-leng th configura tion.  This  demons trates  that  by  remo ving  the clutch  effect,  one  can ach ieve  equal ization  superior  to  that  obtained using  the  sliding  X  une qual and  remove  the  chance  of  an  occasional  lack  of  equali zati on.  While  it's  im practical  in  the  field  to  separ ate  the  str ands  of  the  sliding  X,  doin g  so  while  adding  a  wide -mouth, anodized  bine r  did  res ul t in  near  ideal  equaliz ation  (basically  12 5  pound s  of  di ffe r ence  for  a  1, 500- to  2,0 00-p ound  dynamic  load).  This  begged  for yet  another  round  of  tests  using  the  anodi zed  bin er,  but  not  separ ating  the  str ands  of  the  sliding  X.  Yet  in  the  process  of  re viewing  the  data  and  looking  closely  at  the  sliding  X  itself,  it  became obvious  that  the  sticking  point  was  the  cross  in  the  sling /cord,  the  actual  X  in  the  sys te m.  So  long  as  lim iter  knots  were  used -as  they  al ways  should  be  to  limit  ext ensi on-another  option  presented  itself:  Elimi nate  the  X  and  simpl y  clip  two  locking  biner s  (with  both  \"mouths\"  fa cing  down  and  out)  in to  the  individual  str ands  of  the  sling  between  the  li miter  knots.  This  rigging  system  was  coined  the  \"equale tte .\"  To  determ ine  how  the  equa lette  compar es  to  the sliding  X  and  the  cordele tte  unequal,  a  new  round  of  testi ng  was  conduc ted.  (Note:  Because  it  is  much  mor e  di ff icult  to  ach ie ve  equal ization  with  an  unequal -leng th arm  configuration,  testing  18 8  CLIMBING  ANCHOR S  \nfocused  on  that  mode.)  Ag ain,  to  maintain  consistenc y,  tests  on  the  equale tte  were  per formed  using  pieces  of  cord  and  we bbing  tied  in  14 0cm  to  15 0cm  loops,  the  dynamic  load  (1  00  kg)  was  dropped  on  1 0.2  Sterling  Kosmos  lead  ro pe  and  the  drops  equaled  fa ll  factor  1  on  O.Sm  of  rope  (sta rti ng leng th)  between  figure  eight  knots. In  addition,  the  long  leg  equaled  1  OOcm  +1- 3cm,  the  shor t  leg  equaled  45cm  +1- 3cm  and  the  angle  between  legs  equaled  0  degrees.  E.  Equa lette  unequal  length:  The  equale tte  unequal-leng th  configuration  outp erforms  the  sliding  X  unequal-leng th  configur ati on,  and  it  per forms as we ll  as  the  sliding  X  unequal  with  a  wide-mouth  bine r.  Of  course,  un like the  sliding  X  unequal  wide -mouth  configur ati on,  the  equal ette  has  the  dis tinct  advantage  of  being  practical  to  use  in  the  fi eld.  Equal ization  with  unequal  legs  is di ff icult,  and  though  the  equale tte  did  not  equalize  as  wel l  as  the  best- case  scenario  (s liding  X  with  equal  legs),  it  performs  very  we ll.  In  fact,  the  equale tte  offers the best  equal­ ization among the  unequal-arm  riggings  considered.  Though  the  variation  from  test  to  test  is  greater  for  the  equale tte  unequal  com­ pared  to  the  sliding  X  unequal  with  a  wide-mouth  bin er,  the  actual  abil ity  to  equal­ ize  by the  equale tte  is  so far superior  to  the  sliding  X  that  it  continues  to  be  the  best  choice.  In  sum, this  round  of  results  sh ows  that  the  equale tte  with  unequal  arms  provides  equal ization  equ ivalent  to  that  seen  in  the  sliding  X  equa l-leng th  rig­ ging, and  in  instances  when  one  requir es  an  anchor  with  unequal  arm  lengths,  the  equale tte  per forms  sign ificantly  better  than the  trad itional  sliding  X  and  vastly  bet­ ter  than  the  unequa l-leng th  cordele tte.  ::otdo:� l'3tt&  equal  )(e qual  cord�le tte>  unequal  X  unequal  equalette  uneq •.1al  _,  i  ---�  '  0  3  4  :5  Abo;o!ute  value:  of  dtffat  enc\"'  bel'vef'n  leg&_  ktJ  BELA Y  ANCHORS  18 9  \nNote  about  the  Quad  Extensive testi ng was  also  carried out  on  the  \"quad\"  system  alr eady  described  in  this  chapt er.  Si nce  the  quad  is  essent iall y a  doubled  equale tte,  and  si nce  tests  on  the  quad  rev ealed  num ber s  virtually  iden tical  to  the  equal ette,  an  ill ustrated  argu­ ment  about  the  quad  was  consider ed  super fluous  to  this  discus sion.  Shock Loading  One of the  lo ngest  ongoing  debates  (and  one  that  largely ,  if  not  entir ely ,  has  been  devoid  of  any  test data)  is  the  sub ject  of  \"shock  loading. \"  Because  this  term  has  no  meaning ful  definition,  it  usually  is  mor e  confusing  and  mi sleading  than  in formative.  The  conventi onal  definition  impli es  a force  so  sudden  and terrific it  could  break  bin­ ers  and  snap  sl ings.  The  issue  of  ext ension  in  an  anchor  has  al ways  been  a  par a­ mount  concern  to  climbe rs,  who  feared  such  ext ension  could  cause  this  shock  loading.  When we  looked  to  see  what data  had  been gener ated  to  suppor t  this  claim,  we  found  none,  and  so  we  set  out  to  conduc t  some prelimi nary  tests.  Relevant  to  our  discussion  of  rigging  strat egies,  the key  issue  was  what  hap­ pens when  one  leg  of  a  dynamically  equal ized  system  fa ils  and  the  load  falls  to  the  re maining  leg.  Some have  speculated  that  the  load  somehow  mu ltiplies  between  the  time  of  the  initial  loadi ng/arm  fa il ure,  creating  shock  loading  on the  rema ining  leg.  As  covered  earlier  in  this  book, all  dynamically  equal ized  anchor s  are  only  viable  if  they  use  limi ter  knots  to  limi t  possible  ext ension.  Given that these are  in  place,  we  wondered  what the  testing  might  divulge  when  one  arm  is  allo wed  to  fa il  and  a  dynamic  load  is  sustained  by  the  remaining  arm.  Here is how  we  went  about  the  testi ng.  Leg-Failure  Te st of  Equalette  This  test  used the  same  setup  as  previous  unequal-leg  tests  but  with  the  short  leg  conne cted  with  a  \"fuse.\"  The  fuse  is  meant  to  break  before  the  long  leg.  We reused  a  sample  of  rope  from  ear lier  drop  tests  since  a  dyna mi c  ro pe changes  very  little  after  mul tiple  factor  1  drops,  making  the  total  force  gener ated  fa ir ly  consistent.  Also,  using  the  same  piece  of  climbing  rope  greatly  in creased  the  chances  of  observing  potential  shock  loading  since  after  repeated  dr op  testing  the rope is  only  a  little  mor e  dynamic  than  a  piece  of  static  line.  If  a  shock  load  wer e  ever  going  to  happen,  it  would  happen  no w.  It  should  be  noted  that  when  using  a 1  00  kg  mass  and  low-stretch  rope,  the  forces  are  some what  higher than one  wo uld  expect  with  a  fa ll  factor  of  1.  The  dr op  tower  computer  program  produces  a  force/ti me  cur ve  that  is  qui te  jagged  imm ed iately  after the  leg  fa ilur e, indic ating  lots  of  vibration.  It is obvious  on  the  cur ve  at  what  point  the  fuse  fails.  Im medi ately  after  the  fuse  bl ows,  there  is  a  19 0  CLIMBING AN CHORS  \nsharp  drop  in force  fo ll owed  by  the  vibr ation,  which  is  then  fo ll owed  by  a  nor mal­ looking  curve.  The  peak  force  varied  depending  on  the tenac ity  of  the  fuse.  The  str onger  the  fuse,  the  lower  the  peak  force  on the  re maining  leg;  the  weaker  the  fuse,  the  higher  the  peak  force  on  the  remaining  leg.  Another  in teres ting  fi ndin g  from  these  tests  is  that  the  sum  of  the  force  experienced  by  each  anchor  leg  decreased  as  the  fuse  load  is  increased.  In  short,  ther e  is  no  \"load  multipl ication\"  between  the  ini tial leg  fa ilur e  and  the  mass  slamming  onto  the  rema ining  anchor  poin t  In  other  words,  this  series  of  testi ng  demons trates  concl usively  that  no  cata­ strophic  shock  loading  and  no  \"load  multiplicat ion\"  occur  as  a  result  of  the ext ension.  Sh ock -Loading  Conclusion:  In clim bing  sys tems,  all  the  compon ents  have  a  degree  of  res il ienc y.  These  are  by and  lar ge  only  maxed out  when  a  sect ion  of  unbela yed  static  line  or  hig h-t ensi le-strength  cord  sustains  a  dynamic  load that  is  tr ansm itted  dir ectly  to  the  anchor ,  such  as when  a  leader  clips  off  to  an  anchor  with  a  tech-cord  daisy chain, climbs  up  2 feet  and  slips,  fa llin g 4  feet  dir ectly  onto  the  an chor .  Yo u  can  bust  biner s  this way  because  the gear  can't  handle  mass  deceler ating  that  qui ckly.  Stretch  and  give  allo w  the  mass  to  deceler ate  sl ower.  In the  daisy  chain  fa ll  described  above,  you  basically  have  the  equi valent  of  a  headon  collisi on-some­ thing  that's  not  going  to  happen  when you're  on  a  dynamic  climbing  rope  that is  run ning  through  a  belay device, and when  you're  clipped  into  the  anchor  with the  climbing  rope.  Here  ext ension  simp ly  means  that  the  next  anchor  that  holds  will  be  subjected  to  the  initial  load,  minu s  what  the  fi rst  leg/piece  absorbed.  The  load  does  not  in crease  or  multiply  between  the  ini tial  fa ilur e  of  a  leg  and  the  resultant  loading  on  the  re maining  leg(s).  Mater ials  Te st ing  so  far  has  produced  several  impor tant  and  some  une xpected  findings.  Cordel ettes  by  far  do  the  poor est  job  of  equal izat ion .  The  sliding  X  equal  and  the  equale tte  unequal are clearly the best  configurations  in  terms  of  equal izati on.  We  wo nder ed,  however,  what  role  was  played  by  the  sling  materials  used  in the  tests.  We  first  looked  at  the  cordele tte.  Here  is  what  we  learned .  The bar s in  the gr aphs  represent  the  mean  of  the  absolu te  difference  between  forces  gen erated  between  the  two  arms  of  the  anchor . In  some  cases,  these  bar s  are very  small -close  to  zero -meaning  that  each  arm  of  the  anchor  receives  about  half  of  the  force  gener ated  by  the  fa ll  (i.e.,  equal izati on) .  In other  instances,  the  di fference  in  forces  transm itted  to  each  arm is  qui te  large,  su ggesting  that  one  arm  of  the  anchor  is  experiencing  a  dispropor tionate  amoun t  of  the  force  gener­ ated.  As  was the  case  in  earlier  tests,  we  ideally  wou ld  like  to  see  the  force  dis trib­ uted  equall y  between  the  two  arms  of  the  anchor .

I<:N  Considering  the  cordele tte  equal  riggings,  slight  dif fere nces  are  noted  among  the  sling  materials,  though  su bstantively  they  appear  to  per form  equally  we ll.  A  di f­ ferent  conclusion  is  reached  when  examining  resu lts  from  the  cordele tte  unequal  configur ati on.  Findings  show that  nylon  or  Perlon  provide  better  equal ization  than  Spec tra  or  hi gh-tensil e-stre ngth  cord,  in  the  case of  a  cordele tte  with  unequal  legs.  This  sug gests  that for  equaliz ation  purposes, nylon  is the  pr eferred  material  to  mak e  cordele ttes.  Though  these  results are  based  on  limi ted  data, it  appear s  that  for  a  cordele tte  unequal  setup,  sling  mat erial  does  matter.  Tests  show much  smaller  dif fere nces  in  equal ization  across  sling  materials  for  the  sliding  X  unequal  and  for  the equal ette  unequal.  In  these  configur ati ons,  sling  material  does  not  influence  equali zati on  greatly .  19 2  CLIMB lNG  ANCHORS  \n1/:!  �ncr.  nvlc.11  11  !1  C  tn�il  nvlon  'm.n  perlon  112  1nch  Suectre  bmm  1&.11  <.Otcl  r  2  3  4  '5  Mt>oin  at>�olur�  dlfteren.:e  be<W<'Eln  c.ord:\"lett&  arms  kN  11/Hl tnch  nylon  61nm  te cll  c.ord  r  1  2  3  4  '5  M&an ab�I)IUIP  dtfl etqnoo  l.oqtv. ,een  r:ot t 'PI<'II&  t llm�.  kN  These  findings  reinfor ce  what  we  concluded  in  the  pr evi ous  sections -that  regard less  of  sling  material,  the  cordele tte  is  a  terrible  choice,  the  sliding  X  is  a  bet­ ter  choice  and  the  equal ette  is the best  choice  of  riggings  tested  for  achieving  equali zation  of  two  unequal  legs.  In  addition,  for  use  with  two  side -by- side  pri mar y  anchor s,  the  quad  is  also  a  handy  system that  provides  easy use, brute  strength  and  excellent  equalization.  Summary  The  Ster ling  tests  were  invaluable  because  they  ana lyzed  rigging  syste ms,  rather  than  equi pment,  and  they  appl ied  dynamic  loading  (repli cating  the  forces of  a  real  world  leader  fall)  on  a  dynamic  rope,  as  opposed  to  \"slow  pull\"  or  static  loading  on  BE LA Y  ANCHORS  19 3  \nstatic  ropes.  Slo w-p ull,  static-ro pe  testing is  a  mode  follo wed  in many  eva luations  but  one  that  has  que sti onable  relevance  to  real  world  climbin g  fa lls.  Cli mbers  do  not  lead  on  static  ropes,  and  fa ll s  do  not  happen  slo wly .  Test ing  determ ined  that  unless  a  rigging  system  features  per fectly  equal-le ngth  arms  and  is  used when  the  loading  dir ection  doesn't  change  so  much  as  a  single  degree  (and  these are  alr eady  imposing  lim itations),  equal ization  and  a  fixed  power  poin t  are  mutually  ex clusive.  The  deduction  is  that future  refi neme nts  in  rigging  systems  will probably move  away  from fixed  power  poin ts,  with  their  big,  be efy  knots  that,  ironical ly,  wer e  long  considered  earma rks  of  secu rity  itself.  Some  thi rty  years  ago  the  sliding  X  introduced the  concept  of  a  sliding  power  poin t,  and  the  refi neme nts  and  tentative  new  syste ms  spawned  by  the  Sterl ing  tests  are  the  fi rst  baby  step  in  taking  the  concept  into  the  twenty-first  centu ry.  Because  this  work  is  just  beginning,  I  expect  over  the  next  few  year s  to  see  many  mor e  options  featu ring  a  sliding  power  point.  Simpli fied  ver sions  of  the  Tra ngo  Equal izer ,  as  well  as  other  \"pul ley\"  rigging  sys tems,  have  alr eady  been  pr esented  and  offe r  much  hope  for  futur e  inno vati on.  No  doubt  others  will  devise  new  sys­ tems  that  featur e  strate gies  not  yet  imagined.  A  truly  revo lutionar y  method  is  yet  to  appear;  we'r e  basically  still  tw eaking  syste ms  based  on the  cordele tte  and  the  slid ing  X.  But  no  matter  what  the  futur e  turns  up,  it  is doub tful  that  any  single  rig­ ging  strategy  will prove \"best\"  across  the  board.  A  combina tion  of  techniques  will  surely  be  req uir ed  to  cover  the  varied conditions  found  in real world rock  climbin g.  That much  said,  an  obvious  question  remains  una nswered:  If  the  old  systems­ name ly,  the  cordel ette- tested  so poorly  in  terms  of  equal ization,  why  don't  more  cordel ette- rigged  anchor s  fa il  in  the field?  The  answer  is  lik ely  what  we  touched  on  earlier:  Few  belay  anchor s  (no  matter  the  rigging  system  emp loyed)  have ever  fa iled  because  so  few  anchor s  ever  experience  a  factor  2  fa ll.  But  for  those  very  few  teams  that one  day  will  experience  such  a  fal l-where  the  leader  plu nges  dir ectly  onto  the  bel ay-we  now  have  a  much better idea  of  what  actually  works  in  terms of  equal ization.  It  remains an  engineering  mar vel  that  we  can  hand-place  a  col lection  of  widg ­ ets  in to  features  in  the  rock  and  swiftly  tie  them  off  so  the  load  gets  somewhat  evenly  distributed  throughout  the  matrix.  No  doub t  we  originally  under estimated  how  tricky  equal ization  was  to  ach ieve,  lar gely  set tl ing  for  the cordele tte  on  the  streng th  of  its  appar ent  simpli city  and  util ity.  It  ca me  to  pass that  any  other  rigging  strategy  was  judged  by  the  simpl icity  of  the  cordele tte  (and  other  syste ms  were  generally found  lacking),  while  all  along  the  cordele tte,  if  sub jected  to  a  dynamic  load, was  rarely  perf orming  as  advert ised .  Experience  now  sh ows  that, in terms  of  rigging  syste ms,  the  acronym  KISS  (Keep  It  Sim ple  Stu pid)  is  valuable  only  up  to  a  poin t.  We  are  free-so loing  a  slipp ery  19 4  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nslope  if we  th ink  the  onl y  rigging  system  worth  using  is  one  so  facile  that a  ra nk  beg inner  can  arrange  it  with  no  tr aining  and  no  discrimi nation -a  tota ll y  foolpr oof  setu p.  !n  almo st  any  potentially  lethal  end eavor ,  participa nts  are  required  to  learn  the  basic  procedures  to  safeguard  the adventure.  Climber s  simpl y  have  to  master  some  essential  prot ocols,  and that's  a  fact.  To  expect  rigging  to  be  as  simpl e  as  tyi ng  your  shoes  is  to  expect  too much  from  the  syste ms.  Compar ed  to  what  oth­ ers  learn-and  must  exercise -to  fly  a  plane  or  scuba dive,  clim bers  are  obl iged  to  know  very  little  indeed.  But  it  will  never  get  to  the  point  wher e  clim ber s  must  know  noth ing  at  all.  All  told,  the  St erling  tests  are  but  one  page in an ongoing  investigation  that  will  sir e  in novati ons  as  long  as  humankind  is  inclined  to  pull down on  the Big  St one.  A  recent  thread  on  rigging  strategies  featured  on  Rockcl imbing .com  received  mor e  than  35,000  view s  and  gener ated  500 -plus  res ponses  in  fifteen days. Many  ing en­ ious  rigging  strategies  were  pr esented,  and  mor e  are  sur ely  forth coming.  The  bulk  of these  will  come  from  grass  root  sour ces  for  a  simpl e  rea son:  Rigging  strate gies  are  not  produc ts,  and  climbing  companies  only  test  what  they  sell.  The  gauntlet  has  been  thrown  down:  Future  rigging  methods  must  be  buil t  on  standard  cord  or  webbing  and  cost  no mor e  than  the  cord or  webbing  itself.  No  doodads,  wid gets,  rap  rings  or  pricey  sewing.  Since  there  is  li ttle  pr ofit  to  a  man ufa cturer  in  the  simpli ­ fied  rigging  methods  most  of  us  rely  on,  ther e's  no  motivati on  to  develop  or  test  such  methods,  even  if  the  results  are  inv alu able  to  real  world  climbe rs.  It's  up  to  us.  BELA Y  ANCHOR S  19 5  \nClimber s  rappe lllng  in  the  Needles,  South  Dak ota.  PHOTO BY  BOB  GAINES.",
