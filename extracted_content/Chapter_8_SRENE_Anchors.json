Mar c's  first  acronym  was  RENE.  S  (Solid)  was later  added,  res ulting  in  SRENE ,  which  was  appr opria ted  by  the  IFMGA  (International  Federation  of  Moun­ ta in Gui des  Associat ion),  and  later  by  me in  the  first anchor book.  Si nce  its  inception  SRENE  has for  many  clim bers  become  a  sort  of  fixed-i n-stone  checklist  to  which  every  anchor  must  conform.  This is  not  only  a  per version  of  the  original  intention  of  SRENE, it is  physically  im poss ible  when  SRENE  qual ities  are  sought  in  absolute  literal  terms.  But  that  hasn't  kept  people  from  trying,  which  over  the  last  decade  has  spawned  a  breaking  wave  of  comm entary  based  on  every thing  from  Newt onian  physics  to  blue  wi nd.  Those  favo ring  this  or  that  aspect  of  SRENE  have  squared  off  lik e  Sumo  wrestlers,  charging  each  other  with  the  pas­ sion  of  True  Def ender s  of  the  Faith.  But  lik e  everyone  married  to  doctrine,  they  find  themselv es yarding  on  crumbly  holds  because  when  consider ed  as  inflexible  doc­ trine,  SRENE  embr aces  mutually  ex clusive  quali ties.  For  instance,  with  hand-placed  gear  you can  rarely  if  ever  achie ve  simul taneous  non -ext ension and  equalization.  And  in  the  real  world,  redundancy  is  not  alw ays  possibl e-th ough  alw ays  desi r­ able.  Moun taineer  and  engineer  Cr aig  Connal ly,  in  The  Moun taineering  Handbook,  puts  it  this  way:  \"If static  equaliz ation  invariably  boils  down  to  redundanc y  rather  than true  equali zati on,  and  dynamic  equal ization  doesn't  lead  to  true  shock  load­ ing,  the  old  acronyms  [SRENE ] Ie ave  us  ad rift.  What  then  is  a  rea sonable,  realistic  appr oach  to  building  anchor s?\"  The  only  \"rea son able  and  rea listic\"  appr oach  to  build ing  anchor s  is  to  le ave  off  considering  SRENE  as  an  absol ute  doc tri ne  or  checklist,  and  to  use  SRENE  for  the  purpose  fo r  which  it  was  originally  devised:  as  an  anchor  eva luation  methodol ogy.  If you  were  to  make  a  li st  of  traits  you'd  lik e  in  a  mate,  and  settled  for  not hing  less  13 2  \nKeith  McAllister  on  To ngulation,  New River  Gorge,  West  Virginia.

Same  goes  for  building  anchor s  according  to  SRENE.  Most  every  anchor  is  a  trad e-off  according  to  what  is  actually  required,  and  because  every  aspect  of  SRENE  is  rarely  necessar y  in  any  anch or-and  you'r e  not  going  to  per - SRENE  AN CHORS  13 3  \nfectly  achie ve  them  all  in  any  event -S RENE  is  useful  only  as  an  eva luation  technol­ ogy.  And  to  that  end, SRENE  is  the  best  thing  going.  All  this  mi ght  sound  overly  technical  and  compl icated,  but  in  fact  all  of  these  concep ts  are  based  on  common  sense  and  elem entary  mechan ical  laws  that  are  usually  self -ev ident  once  you  gain  experience.  Sti ll,  let  us  look  closer  at  the  funda­ mental  conc epts  behind  SRENE. Kindly  settle  in  for  the  dur ati on.  Solid  means just  that.  The  indi vidual,  primary  anchor s  and  the  system  as  a  whole  must  be  bombpr oof,  able  to  stop  a rogue  elephan t,  without  question.  Redundant  generally  means  placing  three  or  four  solid  anch ors  (mor e  if  the  anchor s  are  less  than  ideal). Never use  only  one  nut.  Ne ver .  Most  experienced  climb ers  don' t  consider  an  anchor  secure  until  the y  have set  a  minim um  of  three  secure  primar y  placemen ts.  Two  bombpr oof  anch ors  is the  absolu te  minimum,  and  only  is  acceptable  when  more  are not to  be  had.  In  emer gencies  clim ber s  occa­ sionally  will  use  a  single  bolt,  tree  or  tied- off  boulde r  fo r  an  anchor ,  but  secur e  backup  anch or s  will  greatly  reduce  the  chance  of  a  catastro phe.  Likewise,  because  SR E NE  is  an  evaluation  tec h nology  covering  the  anchor as  a  syst em,  eleme nts  within  the  system  (biner s,  sli ngs,  etc.)  should be  backed  up.  Redun danc y  also  can  includ e  setti ng  anch ors  in  mor e  than  one crack  system,  to  avoid relying  on  a  single  rock  feature.  Equal ized  refers  to  distributing,  as  equally  as  possible,  any  potential  loading  to  the  various  primary  anchor s  in  the  syste m.  The  aim  is  to  incr ease  the  over all  strength  of the  system  and to  reduce  the  chance  of  a  single  anchor  pulling out  under  loadi ng.  Perfect  equal ization,  or  even  nearly  pe rfe ct  equali zati on, is  some­ thing  never  fully  achieved.  A  reasonably  distrib uted  load  is  more  often  than  not  all  we  actually  need.  This  concept  will  be  revisited  in  the  next  chapter  dur ing  our  dis­ cussion  of  rigging  methods  such as  the  sliding  X  and  cordele tte.  No  Ext ension  means  that  if  one  of  the  anch or s  in  the  system  should  fa il,  the  system  will  not  suddenl y  become slack and  drop the  clim ber  a  shor t  di stance,  load­ ing  the  re maining  anchor s.  Recent studies  suggest  that  shor t  extens ions  in  loading  are  not  near ly  as  severe  or  dang erous  as  fi rst  thought. Like equal ization,  this  is  a  concept  best  covered  in  our  discussion  of  rigging  methods  in the  next  cha pter .  While  SRENE  is what  we try to  ach ieve,  whenever  huma nly  possible,  when  building  anc hors,  simplic ity  and  efficiency  are  the  bywo rds  of  how  we  go about  our  task.  Simpl icity  means  we  strive  to  keep  the  anchor  basic  and  str eamlined,  exploiting  the  obvious  fea­ tures  with  the  simpl est,  most  obvious  primar y  place­ ments,  and  using  elemen ta ry,  as  opposed  to  garish,  rigging  techniques  whenever  possible.  We don't  13 4  CLI MBING  ANCHOR S  SRENE  Anch ors  Sohd  •  Redun dant  Eq ualized  No  Exten sion  \nwant  the  anchor  equivalent  of  the Taj  Mahal.  We  want  Fort  Knox.  As  we  all  know,  it  is  usuall y  easier  to  judge  the  value  of  a  simple  system  as  opposed  to  a  complic ated  one,  and  with  every  anchor ,  we'r e  wageri ng  our lives on our  judgment  that  the  anchor is  \"good  enough.\"  Keep  it  simple  and  live  to  a  great  age.  Effi cienc y  means  we  aim  to  fa shion  anchor s  that  are  swift  to  build  and  easy to  cle an.  To  do so we  need  to  be  organized  and  effe ctive  in  our  use  of  time  and equip­ ment.  Always  searching  for  the  qu ickest  and  sim plest  method, we  decide  on  a  strategy  and  apply  it  to  ach ie ve  one  basic  goa l-to  build  anchor s  that  are  \"good  enough.\"  On  long  trad routes,  we  arrive  at  bela ys  at  the  end  of  a  lead,  when  we  have  the  least  amount  of  gear  with  which  to  build  an  anchor ,  so the  need  for  us  to  work  effi ciently  cannot  be  overst ated.  Sur e,  we  all  have  an  ideal anchor  we  are  str iving  to  build,  but  mor e  times than  not we'r e  lef t  to  deal  with what  we've  got,  and  what  we've got  is  seldom  ideal.  SRENE  VA RIA TI ONS  Several  vers1ons  of the  SRENE  acronym  have  su rfaced  over  the  last  decade,  mdudmg  SERENE,  ERN EST ,  NERDSS,  DORK,  SKUNK,  SANE  and  several  others .  Each  acronym  contains  the  same  basic  principles  (wh1ch  ar'!  typically  renamed  to  fit  the acronym),  With  some  m1xing  what  Wd bUild  (SRENE)  with  how  we  build it (s1mply  and  effi­ Cien tly) .  There's  nothing  wrong  With  these  acronyms,  but ther e  does rem;;�in  a  com­ munit y- wide  need  to  standardize  this bask  ev al uation  technolo�y  m  the  same  sense  th3t  there  is  a  need  to  have  one  name,  not  ten  names,  for  p1ton .  It is  neJther  s1mple  Mr  eft1 c1ent  to  keep  cooking  up  d1fferent  acronym5  to  package  the  self-sa me  pnncl­ ples .  So  SRENE  it  IS  REDUND ANCY:  THE  ONGOING  DISCUSSION  Re dun danc y,  as  a  valuable  qual ity  in  anchor s,  became  widely  sta ndardized  sho rtly  after  the  fi rst  edition  of  Clim bing  Anchors.  Since  then  the  sub ject  has  dr awn  a  hail­ storm of  argum ents  and  counter -argu men ts  about  A)  what  red undanc y  actually  is,  and  B)  the  relatio nship  of  redunda ncy  and  securit y.  Some  argue  that  redundanc y  and  secu rity  are  synonymous,  that  one  is  impos sible  without  the  other .  This  is  pas­ sionately  denied  by  others,  though  no  one  questions  the  overa ll  impor tance  of  red undanc y.  Since  you'll  encounter  this  sub ject  time  and  again,  both in  print  and  in  the  fi eld,  let's  review  the  basic  debate.  All  anc hors  consist  of  various  link s  of  primar y  placeme nts  and  rigging,  and  the  strength  and  secu rity  of  those  link s  will  alw ays  vary  within  one  anchor  matrix.  To  counter this,  we  bolster  the  mul ti ple  link s  within  the  anchor  system  through  redun­ danc y.  Basical ly,  redunda ncy  demands  that  anchor  syste ms  be  construc ted  of  mul- SRENE  ANCHOR S  13 5  \ntiple  compone nts-fro m  the  primar y  placements,  to  the  sling s  and  bin ers  we  use  in  rigging  the  placemen ts  together -so  that  if  any one  component  fa il s,  the  anchor  will  not  fa il.  In  other words  a  redundant  anchor  never  stakes  our  life  on  one  piece  of  gear .  Yet  in  several  ins tances  we  do  just  that.  We  (almost  al ways)  climb  on  one  rope,  tied  into  one  ha rness,  with  one  bel ay/r appel  loop,  on  whi ch-when  neede d-we  use one  locking  bine r  conn ected  to one belay  device.  This  hur ls us  onto  a  slip per y  slope.  We  can't  trot  out  red undanc y  as an  invio late  rule,  and  break  it at  the  same  time.  The  question becomes  this:  Can  secu rity  only  be  achie ved  through  re dunda ncy?  If  so,  why  do  we  climb on  one  rope,  one  har­ ness,  etc. If not,  where  does this  leave  us  in  terms of  anchor s?  Sim ply  put,  a  fail-safe  anchor ,  not  red undanc y  per se, is  the  ul timate  goal,  and  redunda ncy  is  only  one  imp ortant  tool to  achie ve  that  goa l.  Stated  dif ferently ,  we  build  fail-safe  anchor s  not  to  ply  a  rule  (red undanc y).  but  so  we  don't  di e.  If  redun­ danc y  help s  us  build  fai l-safe  anchor s,  as  it  almo st  alw ays  does, then  we  use  it  whenever  possible.  But  experience  will  eventu all y  show us that  a  viable  anchor  can  be  achie ved,  however  rarely ,  without  letter-perfect  red und anc y.  Furthermor e,  in  the  real  world there  are places  wher e even  the most  experienced  clim bers  cannot  make  redundant  every  facet  of  the  syste m,  and  to  claim and  insist  that  you  can,  and  must,  is  fa lse  and  mi sleading .

It  won't,  a  fact  that an  overwh elming  numb er  of  reader s  demanded  I  point  out.  Every  experienc ed  climber  has on  occasion  wander ed  off -route  and  onto  terra in  where  they were  forced  to  arrange  anchor s  with  no  redunda ncy  whatso­ ever.  It  would  be  a  betrayal  to  imply  this  can  never  happen,  that all  of  your  anchor s  can be  per fect.  Nevertheless,  piss-poor  anchor s  are  for most  clim ber s  an  infrequent  experi­ ence.  By  and  lar ge  there  are  adequa te  anchor s  to  be  had,  and when  there  are,  it  all  boils  down  to  this:  On  the  clif f side,  we  cannot  attach  machi nery  to  our  anchor s  and  objectively  qu antify  their  strength .  In  most  cases  we  must  trust our  abil ity  to  assess  the  probabil ity  of  fa ilur e. On  one  hand  we' re  talking  about  a  personal  judg ­ ment  rooted in  one's  level  of  accept able  risk,  and  on e's  abil ity  to  accur ately  assess  that  risk.  If  your  level  of  acceptable  risk  is  zero  (a  ratio  never  re aliz ed  in  the  climb­ ing  ga me),  then  you'll  try  and  take red undanc y,  and  every  aspect of  SRENE,  further  than  you  need  to  go, and any  anchor  shor t  of  ten  bo lts  will  be  a  deal  br eak er.  Cele­ brated  American  climber  Curt  Shannon  puts  it  this  way:  \"Boeing  747  ai rcraft  do  not  ha ve two  left  wings in  spit e  of  the  fact  that  if  the  single,  non-redundant  le ft  wing  comes  off,  everyone  on  board  will  die.  Same  th ing  with  the  use  of  a  single  rope.  The  point  being  that  it  is  possible  to  design  an  element  of  a  mechanism  (such  as  a  wing,  or a rope)  to  a  sta ndard  of  quali ty  where  a  lack  of  redunda ncy  is  a  moot  issue.\"  A  succinc t  assessment,  but  we'd  be  travers ing  off  early  if  we  le ft  it  at  that.  The  fact  is,  a  climbing  rope,  a  harness,  a  bar -tacked  belay  loop,  a  locking  bine r  and  the  other  nonredundant  items  we  all tru st-e ver y  one  is  exper tly  designed,  factory  made,  sub ject  to  rigorous  qual ity  control  and  tested  by  everyone  with  a  cli pboa rd  and  too  many  pens  in  their  vest.  These  non  redundant  items  are  basically  the  climb ­ ing equ ivalent  of  the  air plane  wing,  with a  fa il  pr obabi li ty  so  small  that,  as  Cur t  poin ted  out,  their  red unda ncy  is a  moot  point.  Climbing  anchor s, on  the other  hand,  are  routi nely  fa shioned  in  junk  rock  by  people  who  little  und erstand  the  gear  or  rigging  techniques  and  have  no  experi­ ence  in  judging  critical  issues  like  dir ection  of  loading  and  fa ll  factors.  To help com­ pensate  for  these  variables,  we  foster  a  mind set  and  tender  a  criteria  (re dundanc y)  sug gesting  that  you  double  up  whatever  you  ca n,  whene ver  you  ca n.  Period.  We  climb  on  one  rope  and  with  one  harness;  we  belay  off  one  tree  when the  tree  is  healthy and  1 0  feet  wide;  and  hating  every  seco nd  of  it,  we  sometimes  ARE  forced  into  belaying  off one nut.  But  redundanc y  is  one  of  our  stated  goals  with  all  anchors.  As  one  climber  put  it  dur ing  an  Internet  discussion:  \"The  pur pose  behind  redundancy  is  to  save  your ass when  your  assumptions  are  wrong.\"  Another  SRENE  ANCHOR S  13 7  \nclimb er  added:  \"A lways  keep  mor e  than  one  fa ilur e  point  between  you  and  the  reaper .  This  way  you  have  to  screw  up  twice  at  the  same time  to  kill  yourself.\"  I  trust  the  pic ture  is  clear .  That  much  said,  does  red undanc y  only  im ply  that  we  should  double  up  every  nut in  the  system?  Actu ally  it's  a  little  more  involved.  To  under stand how  anchor s  actually  work,  you  must  learn  to  consider  the  anchor  beyond  it's  component  pa rts  and  appr eciate  it  as  a  whole,  as  a  mechanical  syste m.  In  this  sense  redunda ncy  becomes  a  much broader  concern.  Redundanc y  asks  one  basic  question:  Can  any one  component  of  the  anchor  fa il  that  in  turn  will  cause the  whole  anchor to  fa il? Ini tially  most  people  consider  redundanc y  in  terms  of  primary  placem ents.  That  is,  if  ther e  are  two  or  mor e  pieces,  then  an  anchor  is  redundant,  rig ht? Not exa ctly.  SRENE  is  an  evaluation  cri­ teria  cov ering  the  entire  anchor  sys tem.  Two  good  bo lts  are  redundant,  but  what  if  we  connect  them  with  one  sling?  If the  sling  blo ws,  we're  goners.  So  two  bo lts  con­ nected  with  one  sling is  not  redundant  in  terms  of  the  syste m.  Barring  huge  trees  and  colossal  blo cks,  the  photos  in  the  ne xt  chapter  illus trate  that  all  acceptable  anchor s  consist  of at  least  two  primar y  anchor s,  or  two  group­ ings  of  primar y  anchors, which  could  also  be  called  the \"l egs\" of  an  anchor  setup.  Redundanc y  in  an  anchor  norma ll y  re quir es  that  each  of  the  two primary  an chor s,  or  legs,  be  strong  enough  to  sustain  wo rst -case  scenario  loading. If  one  or  both of  the  legs  are  not strong  enough  for  such  loading,  then  we  go  after  equal ization/dis ­ tribution  within  a leg,  as  well  as  between the  legs.  By  way  of  overhand  knots  and  clo ve  hitches  we  sometimes  make  redundant  the  arms of  the  slings  cli pped  to  sin­ gle or  mul tiple  primar y  placem en ts.  The  ph otos  and  comm entary  demo nstrate  these  poi nts.  For now  it's  ins tructi onal  to  under stand  what  NASA  di scovered  in  a  study  of  redundant  sys tems:  A.  Assume that  one  leg of  your  anchor  has  a  fa ilur e  potential  of  one  in  a  thousand.  B.  It  foll ows  that  two  equal legs  would  have  a  fa ilur e  rate  of  one  in  a  million  (1  ,000  x  1, 0 00).  c.  Three  legs  would  slig htly  incr ease  the  rel iabil ity.  D.  Four  and  up  make  pr acti cally  no  difference.  The  bottom  line  is  clear: Even when  the  individual  co mpone n ts  of  an  anchor  have  a  fa il ur e  rate  of  one  in  a  thousa nd,  by  simpl y  doubling  them  up  you  incr ease  the  secu rity  by  a  thousand -f old.  This alone  is  a  decis ive  vote  for  doublin g  up  and  mak ing  redundant  every  compone nt  within an  anchor  matrix.  13 8  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nA last red undanc y  concern  is the  maxim  that  you  should  never  place  all  of  your  primar y  placem ents  in  the  same  feature-be  it  in  one  section  of  crack,  behind  one  flake,  etc.  For  better  or  worse, this maxim  can  never  be  realized  acr oss  the  slab.  Many  times  you have  no  choice but to  arrange  an  anchor  in  one  crack,  especially in  gr ani te  areas  like  Yo sem ite.  Neverth eless,  for  several  reasons,  the  maxim  is  valid  as  a  basic  principle.  In  areas  of  suspect  rock,  aim  to  spread  the  primary  placem ent s  over  a  few  di f­ ferent  features,  in  case  one  feature  should  fa il.  Know  that  it's  excepti onall y rare  that a  fa ll  will  dislodge  an entire  featu re.  Mor e  common ly,  a  fa ll  will  shea r  away  the  rock  ar ound  wher e a nut  or cam  is  seated,  as  opposed  to  blo wing  out a  section  of  crack  or  ri pping  a  whole  fiake  off the  wall- though  both have  happened.  Another  reason  to  spread  the  anchor  out  is  that  it  is  difficult  to  arrange  an  acceptably  equalized,  omnid ir ecti onal  belay  from  pri mar y  placemen ts  arranged  solely  in  a  str aight  up  and  down  crack.  Can  you,  or  must you,  ach ieve  re dund anc y  in  every  situation  on  the cl iff side ?  No.  But  as  a  rule  of  thumb,  redundancy  is  at  the top  of  the  list.  Bear this in  min d  when  revi ewing  the photos,  wher e  the  theory  of  redunda ncy  is  appl ied  in  dozens  of  ways.  SRENE  ANCHOR S  13 9",

All  this  mi ght  sound  overly  technical  and  compl icated,  but  in  fact  all  of  these  concep ts  are  based  on  common  sense  and  elem entary  mechan ical  laws  that  are  usually  self -ev ident  once  you  gain  experience.  Sti ll,  let  us  look  closer  at  the  funda­ mental  conc epts  behind  SRENE. Kindly  settle  in  for  the  dur ati on.  Solid  means just  that.  The  indi vidual,  primary  anchor s  and  the  system  as  a  whole  must  be  bombpr oof,  able  to  stop  a rogue  elephan t,  without  question.  Redundant  generally  means  placing  three  or  four  solid  anch ors  (mor e  if  the  anchor s  are  less  than  ideal). Never use  only  one  nut.  Ne ver .  Most  experienced  climb ers  don' t  consider  an  anchor  secure  until  the y  have set  a  minim um  of  three  secure  primar y  placemen ts.  Two  bombpr oof  anch ors  is the  absolu te  minimum,  and  only  is  acceptable  when  more  are not to  be  had.  In  emer gencies  clim ber s  occa­ sionally  will  use  a  single  bolt,  tree  or  tied- off  boulde r  fo r  an  anchor ,  but  secur e  backup  anch or s  will  greatly  reduce  the  chance  of  a  catastro phe.  Likewise,  because  SR E NE  is  an  evaluation  tec h nology  covering  the  anchor as  a  syst em,  eleme nts  within  the  system  (biner s,  sli ngs,  etc.)  should be  backed  up.  Redun danc y  also  can  includ e  setti ng  anch ors  in  mor e  than  one crack  system,  to  avoid relying  on  a  single  rock  feature.  Equal ized  refers  to  distributing,  as  equally  as  possible,  any  potential  loading  to  the  various  primary  anchor s  in  the  syste m.  The  aim  is  to  incr ease  the  over all  strength  of the  system  and to  reduce  the  chance  of  a  single  anchor  pulling out  under  loadi ng.  Perfect  equal ization,  or  even  nearly  pe rfe ct  equali zati on, is  some­ thing  never  fully  achieved.  A  reasonably  distrib uted  load  is  more  often  than  not  all  we  actually  need.  This  concept  will  be  revisited  in  the  next  chapter  dur ing  our  dis­ cussion  of  rigging  methods  such as  the  sliding  X  and  cordele tte.  No  Ext ension  means  that  if  one  of  the  anch or s  in  the  system  should  fa il,  the  system  will  not  suddenl y  become slack and  drop the  clim ber  a  shor t  di stance,  load­ ing  the  re maining  anchor s.  Recent studies  suggest  that  shor t  extens ions  in  loading  are  not  near ly  as  severe  or  dang erous  as  fi rst  thought. Like equal ization,  this  is  a  concept  best  covered  in  our  discussion  of  rigging  methods  in the  next  cha pter .  While  SRENE  is what  we try to  ach ieve,  whenever  huma nly  possible,  when  building  anc hors,  simplic ity  and  efficiency  are  the  bywo rds  of  how  we  go about  our  task.  Simpl icity  means  we  strive  to  keep  the  anchor  basic  and  str eamlined,  exploiting  the  obvious  fea­ tures  with  the  simpl est,  most  obvious  primar y  place­ ments,  and  using  elemen ta ry,  as  opposed  to  garish,  rigging  techniques  whenever  possible.

Since  then  the  sub ject  has  dr awn  a  hail­ storm of  argum ents  and  counter -argu men ts  about  A)  what  red undanc y  actually  is,  and  B)  the  relatio nship  of  redunda ncy  and  securit y.  Some  argue  that  redundanc y  and  secu rity  are  synonymous,  that  one  is  impos sible  without  the  other .  This  is  pas­ sionately  denied  by  others,  though  no  one  questions  the  overa ll  impor tance  of  red undanc y.  Since  you'll  encounter  this  sub ject  time  and  again,  both in  print  and  in  the  fi eld,  let's  review  the  basic  debate.  All  anc hors  consist  of  various  link s  of  primar y  placeme nts  and  rigging,  and  the  strength  and  secu rity  of  those  link s  will  alw ays  vary  within  one  anchor  matrix.  To  counter this,  we  bolster  the  mul ti ple  link s  within  the  anchor  system  through  redun­ danc y.

In  other words  a  redundant  anchor  never  stakes  our  life  on  one  piece  of  gear .  Yet  in  several  ins tances  we  do  just  that.  We  (almost  al ways)  climb  on  one  rope,  tied  into  one  ha rness,  with  one  bel ay/r appel  loop,  on  whi ch-when  neede d-we  use one  locking  bine r  conn ected  to one belay  device.  This  hur ls us  onto  a  slip per y  slope.  We  can't  trot  out  red undanc y  as an  invio late  rule,  and  break  it at  the  same  time.  The  question becomes  this:  Can  secu rity  only  be  achie ved  through  re dunda ncy?  If  so,  why  do  we  climb on  one  rope,  one  har­ ness,  etc. If not,  where  does this  leave  us  in  terms of  anchor s?  Sim ply  put,  a  fail-safe  anchor ,  not  red undanc y  per se, is  the  ul timate  goal,  and  redunda ncy  is  only  one  imp ortant  tool to  achie ve  that  goa l.

If  redun­ danc y  help s  us  build  fai l-safe  anchor s,  as  it  almo st  alw ays  does, then  we  use  it  whenever  possible.  But  experience  will  eventu all y  show us that  a  viable  anchor  can  be  achie ved,  however  rarely ,  without  letter-perfect  red und anc y.  Furthermor e,  in  the  real  world there  are places  wher e even  the most  experienced  clim bers  cannot  make  redundant  every  facet  of  the  syste m,  and  to  claim and  insist  that  you  can,  and  must,  is  fa lse  and  mi sleading .

It  won't,  a  fact  that an  overwh elming  numb er  of  reader s  demanded  I  point  out.  Every  experienc ed  climber  has on  occasion  wander ed  off -route  and  onto  terra in  where  they were  forced  to  arrange  anchor s  with  no  redunda ncy  whatso­ ever.  It  would  be  a  betrayal  to  imply  this  can  never  happen,  that all  of  your  anchor s  can be  per fect.  Nevertheless,  piss-poor  anchor s  are  for most  clim ber s  an  infrequent  experi­ ence.  By  and  lar ge  there  are  adequa te  anchor s  to  be  had,  and when  there  are,  it  all  boils  down  to  this:  On  the  clif f side,  we  cannot  attach  machi nery  to  our  anchor s  and  objectively  qu antify  their  strength .  In  most  cases  we  must  trust our  abil ity  to  assess  the  probabil ity  of  fa ilur e. On  one  hand  we' re  talking  about  a  personal  judg ­ ment  rooted in  one's  level  of  accept able  risk,  and  on e's  abil ity  to  accur ately  assess  that  risk.  If  your  level  of  acceptable  risk  is  zero  (a  ratio  never  re aliz ed  in  the  climb­ ing  ga me),  then  you'll  try  and  take red undanc y,  and  every  aspect of  SRENE,  further  than  you  need  to  go, and any  anchor  shor t  of  ten  bo lts  will  be  a  deal  br eak er.  Cele­ brated  American  climber  Curt  Shannon  puts  it  this  way:  \"Boeing  747  ai rcraft  do  not  ha ve two  left  wings in  spit e  of  the  fact  that  if  the  single,  non-redundant  le ft  wing  comes  off,  everyone  on  board  will  die.  Same  th ing  with  the  use  of  a  single  rope.  The  point  being  that  it  is  possible  to  design  an  element  of  a  mechanism  (such  as  a  wing,  or a rope)  to  a  sta ndard  of  quali ty  where  a  lack  of  redunda ncy  is  a  moot  issue.\"  A  succinc t  assessment,  but  we'd  be  travers ing  off  early  if  we  le ft  it  at  that.  The  fact  is,  a  climbing  rope,  a  harness,  a  bar -tacked  belay  loop,  a  locking  bine r  and  the  other  nonredundant  items  we  all tru st-e ver y  one  is  exper tly  designed,  factory  made,  sub ject  to  rigorous  qual ity  control  and  tested  by  everyone  with  a  cli pboa rd  and  too  many  pens  in  their  vest.  These  non  redundant  items  are  basically  the  climb ­ ing equ ivalent  of  the  air plane  wing,  with a  fa il  pr obabi li ty  so  small  that,  as  Cur t  poin ted  out,  their  red unda ncy  is a  moot  point.  Climbing  anchor s, on  the other  hand,  are  routi nely  fa shioned  in  junk  rock  by  people  who  little  und erstand  the  gear  or  rigging  techniques  and  have  no  experi­ ence  in  judging  critical  issues  like  dir ection  of  loading  and  fa ll  factors.  To help com­ pensate  for  these  variables,  we  foster  a  mind set  and  tender  a  criteria  (re dundanc y)  sug gesting  that  you  double  up  whatever  you  ca n,  whene ver  you  ca n.  Period.  We  climb  on  one  rope  and  with  one  harness;  we  belay  off  one  tree  when the  tree  is  healthy and  1 0  feet  wide;  and  hating  every  seco nd  of  it,  we  sometimes  ARE  forced  into  belaying  off one nut.  But  redundanc y  is  one  of  our  stated  goals  with  all  anchors.  As  one  climber  put  it  dur ing  an  Internet  discussion:  \"The  pur pose  behind  redundancy  is  to  save  your ass when  your  assumptions  are  wrong.\"  Another  SRENE  ANCHOR S  13 7  ",

This  way  you  have  to  screw  up  twice  at  the  same time  to  kill  yourself.\"  I  trust  the  pic ture  is  clear .  That  much  said,  does  red undanc y  only  im ply  that  we  should  double  up  every  nut in  the  system?  Actu ally  it's  a  little  more  involved.  To  under stand how  anchor s  actually  work,  you  must  learn  to  consider  the  anchor  beyond  it's  component  pa rts  and  appr eciate  it  as  a  whole,  as  a  mechanical  syste m.  In  this  sense  redunda ncy  becomes  a  much broader  concern.  Redundanc y  asks  one  basic  question:  Can  any one  component  of  the  anchor  fa il  that  in  turn  will  cause the  whole  anchor to  fa il? Ini tially  most  people  consider  redundanc y  in  terms  of  primary  placem ents.  That  is,  if  ther e  are  two  or  mor e  pieces,  then  an  anchor  is  redundant,  rig ht? Not exa ctly.  SRENE  is  an  evaluation  cri­ teria  cov ering  the  entire  anchor  sys tem.  Two  good  bo lts  are  redundant,  but  what  if  we  connect  them  with  one  sling?  If the  sling  blo ws,  we're  goners.  So  two  bo lts  con­ nected  with  one  sling is  not  redundant  in  terms  of  the  syste m.  Barring  huge  trees  and  colossal  blo cks,  the  photos  in  the  ne xt  chapter  illus trate  that  all  acceptable  anchor s  consist  of at  least  two  primar y  anchor s,  or  two  group­ ings  of  primar y  anchors, which  could  also  be  called  the \"l egs\" of  an  anchor  setup.  Redundanc y  in  an  anchor  norma ll y  re quir es  that  each  of  the  two primary  an chor s,  or  legs,  be  strong  enough  to  sustain  wo rst -case  scenario  loading. If  one  or  both of  the  legs  are  not strong  enough  for  such  loading,  then  we  go  after  equal ization/dis ­ tribution  within  a leg,  as  well  as  between the  legs.  By  way  of  overhand  knots  and  clo ve  hitches  we  sometimes  make  redundant  the  arms of  the  slings  cli pped  to  sin­ gle or  mul tiple  primar y  placem en ts.  The  ph otos  and  comm entary  demo nstrate  these  poi nts.  For now  it's  ins tructi onal  to  under stand  what  NASA  di scovered  in  a  study  of  redundant  sys tems:  A.  Assume that  one  leg of  your  anchor  has  a  fa ilur e  potential  of  one  in  a  thousand.  B.  It  foll ows  that  two  equal legs  would  have  a  fa ilur e  rate  of  one  in  a  million  (1  ,000  x  1, 0 00).  c.  Three  legs  would  slig htly  incr ease  the  rel iabil ity.  D.  Four  and  up  make  pr acti cally  no  difference.  The  bottom  line  is  clear: Even when  the  individual  co mpone n ts  of  an  anchor  have  a  fa il ur e  rate  of  one  in  a  thousa nd,  by  simpl y  doubling  them  up  you  incr ease  the  secu rity  by  a  thousand -f old.  This alone  is  a  decis ive  vote  for  doublin g  up  and  mak ing  redundant  every  compone nt  within an  anchor  matrix.  13 8  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  ",
    "8": "A last red undanc y  concern  is the  maxim  that  you  should  never  place  all  of  your  primar y  placem ents  in  the  same  feature-be  it  in  one  section  of  crack,  behind  one  flake,  etc.  For  better  or  worse, this maxim  can  never  be  realized  acr oss  the  slab.  Many  times  you have  no  choice but to  arrange  an  anchor  in  one  crack,  especially in  gr ani te  areas  like  Yo sem ite.  Neverth eless,  for  several  reasons,  the  maxim  is  valid  as  a  basic  principle.  In  areas  of  suspect  rock,  aim  to  spread  the  primary  placem ent s  over  a  few  di f­ ferent  features,  in  case  one  feature  should  fa il.

And  to  that  end, SRENE  is  the  best  thing  going.  All  this  mi ght  sound  overly  technical  and  compl icated,  but  in  fact  all  of  these  concep ts  are  based  on  common  sense  and  elem entary  mechan ical  laws  that  are  usually  self -ev ident  once  you  gain  experience.  Sti ll,  let  us  look  closer  at  the  funda­ mental  conc epts  behind  SRENE. Kindly  settle  in  for  the  dur ati on.  Solid  means just  that.  The  indi vidual,  primary  anchor s  and  the  system  as  a  whole  must  be  bombpr oof,  able  to  stop  a rogue  elephan t,  without  question.  Redundant  generally  means  placing  three  or  four  solid  anch ors  (mor e  if  the  anchor s  are  less  than  ideal). Never use  only  one  nut.  Ne ver .  Most  experienced  climb ers  don' t  consider  an  anchor  secure  until  the y  have set  a  minim um  of  three  secure  primar y  placemen ts.  Two  bombpr oof  anch ors  is the  absolu te  minimum,  and  only  is  acceptable  when  more  are not to  be  had.  In  emer gencies  clim ber s  occa­ sionally  will  use  a  single  bolt,  tree  or  tied- off  boulde r  fo r  an  anchor ,  but  secur e  backup  anch or s  will  greatly  reduce  the  chance  of  a  catastro phe.  Likewise,  because  SR E NE  is  an  evaluation  tec h nology  covering  the  anchor as  a  syst em,  eleme nts  within  the  system  (biner s,  sli ngs,  etc.)  should be  backed  up.  Redun danc y  also  can  includ e  setti ng  anch ors  in  mor e  than  one crack  system,  to  avoid relying  on  a  single  rock  feature.  Equal ized  refers  to  distributing,  as  equally  as  possible,  any  potential  loading  to  the  various  primary  anchor s  in  the  syste m.  The  aim  is  to  incr ease  the  over all  strength  of the  system  and to  reduce  the  chance  of  a  single  anchor  pulling out  under  loadi ng.  Perfect  equal ization,  or  even  nearly  pe rfe ct  equali zati on, is  some­ thing  never  fully  achieved.  A  reasonably  distrib uted  load  is  more  often  than  not  all  we  actually  need.  This  concept  will  be  revisited  in  the  next  chapter  dur ing  our  dis­ cussion  of  rigging  methods  such as  the  sliding  X  and  cordele tte.  No  Ext ension  means  that  if  one  of  the  anch or s  in  the  system  should  fa il,  the  system  will  not  suddenl y  become slack and  drop the  clim ber  a  shor t  di stance,  load­ ing  the  re maining  anchor s.  Recent studies  suggest  that  shor t  extens ions  in  loading  are  not  near ly  as  severe  or  dang erous  as  fi rst  thought. Like equal ization,  this  is  a  concept  best  covered  in  our  discussion  of  rigging  methods  in the  next  cha pter .  While  SRENE  is what  we try to  ach ieve,  whenever  huma nly  possible,  when  building  anc hors,  simplic ity  and  efficiency  are  the  bywo rds  of  how  we  go about  our  task.  Simpl icity  means  we  strive  to  keep  the  anchor  basic  and  str eamlined,  exploiting  the  obvious  fea­ tures  with  the  simpl est,  most  obvious  primar y  place­ ments,  and  using  elemen ta ry,  as  opposed  to  garish,  rigging  techniques  whenever  possible.  We don't  13 4  CLI MBING  ANCHOR S  SRENE  Anch ors  Sohd  •  Redun dant  Eq ualized  No  Exten sion  \nwant  the  anchor  equivalent  of  the Taj  Mahal.  We  want  Fort  Knox.  As  we  all  know,  it  is  usuall y  easier  to  judge  the  value  of  a  simple  system  as  opposed  to  a  complic ated  one,  and  with  every  anchor ,  we'r e  wageri ng  our lives on our  judgment  that  the  anchor is  \"good  enough.\"  Keep  it  simple  and  live  to  a  great  age.  Effi cienc y  means  we  aim  to  fa shion  anchor s  that  are  swift  to  build  and  easy to  cle an.  To  do so we  need  to  be  organized  and  effe ctive  in  our  use  of  time  and equip­ ment.  Always  searching  for  the  qu ickest  and  sim plest  method, we  decide  on  a  strategy  and  apply  it  to  ach ie ve  one  basic  goa l-to  build  anchor s  that  are  \"good  enough.\"  On  long  trad routes,  we  arrive  at  bela ys  at  the  end  of  a  lead,  when  we  have  the  least  amount  of  gear  with  which  to  build  an  anchor ,  so the  need  for  us  to  work  effi ciently  cannot  be  overst ated.  Sur e,  we  all  have  an  ideal anchor  we  are  str iving  to  build,  but  mor e  times than  not we'r e  lef t  to  deal  with what  we've  got,  and  what  we've got  is  seldom  ideal.  SRENE  VA RIA TI ONS  Several  vers1ons  of the  SRENE  acronym  have  su rfaced  over  the  last  decade,  mdudmg  SERENE,  ERN EST ,  NERDSS,  DORK,  SKUNK,  SANE  and  several  others .  Each  acronym  contains  the  same  basic  principles  (wh1ch  ar'!  typically  renamed  to  fit  the acronym),  With  some  m1xing  what  Wd bUild  (SRENE)  with  how  we  build it (s1mply  and  effi­ Cien tly) .  There's  nothing  wrong  With  these  acronyms,  but ther e  does rem;;�in  a  com­ munit y- wide  need  to  standardize  this bask  ev al uation  technolo�y  m  the  same  sense  th3t  there  is  a  need  to  have  one  name,  not  ten  names,  for  p1ton .  It is  neJther  s1mple  Mr  eft1 c1ent  to  keep  cooking  up  d1fferent  acronym5  to  package  the  self-sa me  pnncl­ ples .  So  SRENE  it  IS  REDUND ANCY:  THE  ONGOING  DISCUSSION  Re dun danc y,  as  a  valuable  qual ity  in  anchor s,  became  widely  sta ndardized  sho rtly  after  the  fi rst  edition  of  Clim bing  Anchors.  Since  then  the  sub ject  has  dr awn  a  hail­ storm of  argum ents  and  counter -argu men ts  about  A)  what  red undanc y  actually  is,  and  B)  the  relatio nship  of  redunda ncy  and  securit y.  Some  argue  that  redundanc y  and  secu rity  are  synonymous,  that  one  is  impos sible  without  the  other .  This  is  pas­ sionately  denied  by  others,  though  no  one  questions  the  overa ll  impor tance  of  red undanc y.  Since  you'll  encounter  this  sub ject  time  and  again,  both in  print  and  in  the  fi eld,  let's  review  the  basic  debate.  All  anc hors  consist  of  various  link s  of  primar y  placeme nts  and  rigging,  and  the  strength  and  secu rity  of  those  link s  will  alw ays  vary  within  one  anchor  matrix.  To  counter this,  we  bolster  the  mul ti ple  link s  within  the  anchor  system  through  redun­ danc y.  Basical ly,  redunda ncy  demands  that  anchor  syste ms  be  construc ted  of  mul- SRENE  ANCHOR S  13 5  \ntiple  compone nts-fro m  the  primar y  placements,  to  the  sling s  and  bin ers  we  use  in  rigging  the  placemen ts  together -so  that  if  any one  component  fa il s,  the  anchor  will  not  fa il.  In  other words  a  redundant  anchor  never  stakes  our  life  on  one  piece  of  gear .  Yet  in  several  ins tances  we  do  just  that.  We  (almost  al ways)  climb  on  one  rope,  tied  into  one  ha rness,  with  one  bel ay/r appel  loop,  on  whi ch-when  neede d-we  use one  locking  bine r  conn ected  to one belay  device.  This  hur ls us  onto  a  slip per y  slope.  We  can't  trot  out  red undanc y  as an  invio late  rule,  and  break  it at  the  same  time.  The  question becomes  this:  Can  secu rity  only  be  achie ved  through  re dunda ncy?  If  so,  why  do  we  climb on  one  rope,  one  har­ ness,  etc. If not,  where  does this  leave  us  in  terms of  anchor s?  Sim ply  put,  a  fail-safe  anchor ,  not  red undanc y  per se, is  the  ul timate  goal,  and  redunda ncy  is  only  one  imp ortant  tool to  achie ve  that  goa l.  Stated  dif ferently ,  we  build  fail-safe  anchor s  not  to  ply  a  rule  (red undanc y).  but  so  we  don't  di e.  If  redun­ danc y  help s  us  build  fai l-safe  anchor s,  as  it  almo st  alw ays  does, then  we  use  it  whenever  possible.  But  experience  will  eventu all y  show us that  a  viable  anchor  can  be  achie ved,  however  rarely ,  without  letter-perfect  red und anc y.  Furthermor e,  in  the  real  world there  are places  wher e even  the most  experienced  clim bers  cannot  make  redundant  every  facet  of  the  syste m,  and  to  claim and  insist  that  you  can,  and  must,  is  fa lse  and  mi sleading .

It  won't,  a  fact  that an  overwh elming  numb er  of  reader s  demanded  I  point  out.  Every  experienc ed  climber  has on  occasion  wander ed  off -route  and  onto  terra in  where  they were  forced  to  arrange  anchor s  with  no  redunda ncy  whatso­ ever.  It  would  be  a  betrayal  to  imply  this  can  never  happen,  that all  of  your  anchor s  can be  per fect.  Nevertheless,  piss-poor  anchor s  are  for most  clim ber s  an  infrequent  experi­ ence.  By  and  lar ge  there  are  adequa te  anchor s  to  be  had,  and when  there  are,  it  all  boils  down  to  this:  On  the  clif f side,  we  cannot  attach  machi nery  to  our  anchor s  and  objectively  qu antify  their  strength .  In  most  cases  we  must  trust our  abil ity  to  assess  the  probabil ity  of  fa ilur e. On  one  hand  we' re  talking  about  a  personal  judg ­ ment  rooted in  one's  level  of  accept able  risk,  and  on e's  abil ity  to  accur ately  assess  that  risk.  If  your  level  of  acceptable  risk  is  zero  (a  ratio  never  re aliz ed  in  the  climb­ ing  ga me),  then  you'll  try  and  take red undanc y,  and  every  aspect of  SRENE,  further  than  you  need  to  go, and any  anchor  shor t  of  ten  bo lts  will  be  a  deal  br eak er.  Cele­ brated  American  climber  Curt  Shannon  puts  it  this  way:  \"Boeing  747  ai rcraft  do  not  ha ve two  left  wings in  spit e  of  the  fact  that  if  the  single,  non-redundant  le ft  wing  comes  off,  everyone  on  board  will  die.  Same  th ing  with  the  use  of  a  single  rope.  The  point  being  that  it  is  possible  to  design  an  element  of  a  mechanism  (such  as  a  wing,  or a rope)  to  a  sta ndard  of  quali ty  where  a  lack  of  redunda ncy  is  a  moot  issue.\"  A  succinc t  assessment,  but  we'd  be  travers ing  off  early  if  we  le ft  it  at  that.  The  fact  is,  a  climbing  rope,  a  harness,  a  bar -tacked  belay  loop,  a  locking  bine r  and  the  other  nonredundant  items  we  all tru st-e ver y  one  is  exper tly  designed,  factory  made,  sub ject  to  rigorous  qual ity  control  and  tested  by  everyone  with  a  cli pboa rd  and  too  many  pens  in  their  vest.  These  non  redundant  items  are  basically  the  climb ­ ing equ ivalent  of  the  air plane  wing,  with a  fa il  pr obabi li ty  so  small  that,  as  Cur t  poin ted  out,  their  red unda ncy  is a  moot  point.  Climbing  anchor s, on  the other  hand,  are  routi nely  fa shioned  in  junk  rock  by  people  who  little  und erstand  the  gear  or  rigging  techniques  and  have  no  experi­ ence  in  judging  critical  issues  like  dir ection  of  loading  and  fa ll  factors.  To help com­ pensate  for  these  variables,  we  foster  a  mind set  and  tender  a  criteria  (re dundanc y)  sug gesting  that  you  double  up  whatever  you  ca n,  whene ver  you  ca n.  Period.  We  climb  on  one  rope  and  with  one  harness;  we  belay  off  one  tree  when the  tree  is  healthy and  1 0  feet  wide;  and  hating  every  seco nd  of  it,  we  sometimes  ARE  forced  into  belaying  off one nut.  But  redundanc y  is  one  of  our  stated  goals  with  all  anchors.  As  one  climber  put  it  dur ing  an  Internet  discussion:  \"The  pur pose  behind  redundancy  is  to  save  your ass when  your  assumptions  are  wrong.\"  Another  SRENE  ANCHOR S  13 7  \nclimb er  added:  \"A lways  keep  mor e  than  one  fa ilur e  point  between  you  and  the  reaper .  This  way  you  have  to  screw  up  twice  at  the  same time  to  kill  yourself.\"  I  trust  the  pic ture  is  clear .  That  much  said,  does  red undanc y  only  im ply  that  we  should  double  up  every  nut in  the  system?  Actu ally  it's  a  little  more  involved.  To  under stand how  anchor s  actually  work,  you  must  learn  to  consider  the  anchor  beyond  it's  component  pa rts  and  appr eciate  it  as  a  whole,  as  a  mechanical  syste m.  In  this  sense  redunda ncy  becomes  a  much broader  concern.  Redundanc y  asks  one  basic  question:  Can  any one  component  of  the  anchor  fa il  that  in  turn  will  cause the  whole  anchor to  fa il? Ini tially  most  people  consider  redundanc y  in  terms  of  primary  placem ents.  That  is,  if  ther e  are  two  or  mor e  pieces,  then  an  anchor  is  redundant,  rig ht? Not exa ctly.  SRENE  is  an  evaluation  cri­ teria  cov ering  the  entire  anchor  sys tem.  Two  good  bo lts  are  redundant,  but  what  if  we  connect  them  with  one  sling?  If the  sling  blo ws,  we're  goners.  So  two  bo lts  con­ nected  with  one  sling is  not  redundant  in  terms  of  the  syste m.  Barring  huge  trees  and  colossal  blo cks,  the  photos  in  the  ne xt  chapter  illus trate  that  all  acceptable  anchor s  consist  of at  least  two  primar y  anchor s,  or  two  group­ ings  of  primar y  anchors, which  could  also  be  called  the \"l egs\" of  an  anchor  setup.  Redundanc y  in  an  anchor  norma ll y  re quir es  that  each  of  the  two primary  an chor s,  or  legs,  be  strong  enough  to  sustain  wo rst -case  scenario  loading. If  one  or  both of  the  legs  are  not strong  enough  for  such  loading,  then  we  go  after  equal ization/dis ­ tribution  within  a leg,  as  well  as  between the  legs.  By  way  of  overhand  knots  and  clo ve  hitches  we  sometimes  make  redundant  the  arms of  the  slings  cli pped  to  sin­ gle or  mul tiple  primar y  placem en ts.  The  ph otos  and  comm entary  demo nstrate  these  poi nts.  For now  it's  ins tructi onal  to  under stand  what  NASA  di scovered  in  a  study  of  redundant  sys tems:  A.  Assume that  one  leg of  your  anchor  has  a  fa ilur e  potential  of  one  in  a  thousand.  B.  It  foll ows  that  two  equal legs  would  have  a  fa ilur e  rate  of  one  in  a  million  (1  ,000  x  1, 0 00).  c.  Three  legs  would  slig htly  incr ease  the  rel iabil ity.  D.  Four  and  up  make  pr acti cally  no  difference.  The  bottom  line  is  clear: Even when  the  individual  co mpone n ts  of  an  anchor  have  a  fa il ur e  rate  of  one  in  a  thousa nd,  by  simpl y  doubling  them  up  you  incr ease  the  secu rity  by  a  thousand -f old.  This alone  is  a  decis ive  vote  for  doublin g  up  and  mak ing  redundant  every  compone nt  within an  anchor  matrix.  13 8  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nA last red undanc y  concern  is the  maxim  that  you  should  never  place  all  of  your  primar y  placem ents  in  the  same  feature-be  it  in  one  section  of  crack,  behind  one  flake,  etc.  For  better  or  worse, this maxim  can  never  be  realized  acr oss  the  slab.  Many  times  you have  no  choice but to  arrange  an  anchor  in  one  crack,  especially in  gr ani te  areas  like  Yo sem ite.  Neverth eless,  for  several  reasons,  the  maxim  is  valid  as  a  basic  principle.  In  areas  of  suspect  rock,  aim  to  spread  the  primary  placem ent s  over  a  few  di f­ ferent  features,  in  case  one  feature  should  fa il.  Know  that  it's  excepti onall y rare  that a  fa ll  will  dislodge  an entire  featu re.  Mor e  common ly,  a  fa ll  will  shea r  away  the  rock  ar ound  wher e a nut  or cam  is  seated,  as  opposed  to  blo wing  out a  section  of  crack  or  ri pping  a  whole  fiake  off the  wall- though  both have  happened.  Another  reason  to  spread  the  anchor  out  is  that  it  is  difficult  to  arrange  an  acceptably  equalized,  omnid ir ecti onal  belay  from  pri mar y  placemen ts  arranged  solely  in  a  str aight  up  and  down  crack.  Can  you,  or  must you,  ach ieve  re dund anc y  in  every  situation  on  the cl iff side ?  No.  But  as  a  rule  of  thumb,  redundancy  is  at  the top  of  the  list.  Bear this in  min d  when  revi ewing  the photos,  wher e  the  theory  of  redunda ncy  is  appl ied  in  dozens  of  ways.  SRENE  ANCHOR S  13 9",
