Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nKnots This  chapter  introduces  the  most  commonly  used  knots  for  sport  climbing. Every  climber  should  be  able  to  recognize, tie and untie the following  knots without having to think about it.  Remember that you may have to tie  them in situations which are far from  ideal  and  you  will  trust  your  life  to  each knot. Dressing After  tying  any  knot,  it  is  important  that you  dress  it correctly. This means  tightening each strand and adjusting  the  loops  and  twists  so  they  are  perfectly  aligned.  Your  knots  should  look exactly like the diagrams in this  book. A knot which isn’t well dressed  could slip or fail. Diameter,  Flexibility  and  Surface  Friction The  examples  given  in  this  book  assume  that  you  are  tying  identical  sections  of  cord  or  rope  together.  Knots  work  best  when  every  rope  involved  is  of  the  same  diameter,  flexibility,  elasticity  and  surface  friction. Minor  differences  are  fine.  For  example,  tying  a  9.5mm  and  a  10.2mm dynamic rope end-to-end for  abseiling is safe. But tying a 6mm tag  line to a 10.2mm rope with the same  knot will  probably result  in that knot  falling apart. Likewise,  a  knot  joining  an  old,  stiff  static rope to a slick, flexible dynamic  rope is likely to slip, even if they are  the same diameter. Figure-8 Tie In Uses The  figure-8  is  widely  accepted  as  being the safest knot to tie-in with. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 106 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStep 1 Make  a  loop  about  a  meter from the end of  the rope. Wrap the end  of the rope around the  base of the loop, then  push  the  end  through  as shown. Step 2 You should end up with  an  '8'.  Make  sure  the  knot  is  around  90cm  from  the  end  of  the  rope  (the  exact  length  varies  with  ropes  of  different diameters). Step 3 Pass the end of the rope  through  both  of the two  points  on  the  front  centre  of  your  harness  –  the  same  ones  your  belay loop runs through.  It  is  important  that  the  rope  goes  through  your  harness  in  exactly  the  same way as your belay  loop does. ~90cm Step 4 Use  the  end  of  the  rope  to  re-trace  the  figure-8.  Follow  the  twists  of  the  rope  starting  from where it  joins your harness. Step 6 Make  sure  the  tail  of  rope  is  around  25cm  long. If it is shorter, you'll  have  to  untie  and  start  again. After this, you will  need  to  tie  a  stopper  knot.  Loop  the  short  section  of  rope  around  the main length. Step 5 Continue  following  the  twists  until  you  end  up  back at the start of the  knot. Pull  the  whole  thing  tight. 2 5 c m VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 107 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStep 7 Do this twice, with the  second  loop  closer  to  you than the first. Step 8 Push  the  end  of  the  rope through these two  loops, as shown. Step 9 Pull this tight too (make  sure it's pushed right up  to your figure-8 knot). Figure-8 on a Bight Uses -  Attaching the rope to an anchor. Step 1 Take  a  bight  of  rope  and form an ‘8’ shape  as shown. Step 2 Push  the  end  of  the  rope  through  the  top  part of the 8. Step 3 Pull it tight. Creating  a  master  point  in  a  cordelette or sling. -  VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 108 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStopper Knot When tying a figure-8 in the end of a  rope,  make  sure  to  add  a  stopper  knot. Warning! Figure-8’s should only be end-loaded  (pulled along the line of the knot). If you load the loop in two opposing  directions, the knot can roll over itself  and lose strength or fail completely. For this reason, you should never use  the figure-8 to join ropes for abseiling. Step 1 Make  two  identical  loops  in  the  rope.  Put  the  rear  loop  over  the  top of the front loop. Step 2 Clip  a  screwgate  carabiner  (never  use  a  snapgate  carabiner)  through  these  two  loops. Step 3 Pull  it  tight  and  fasten  the screwgate. Clovehitch Uses -  Attaching yourself to the anchor. - Attaching  ropes,  cord  or  slings  to  carabiners. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 109 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nOverhand Loop Creating  a  master  point  in  a  cordelette or sling. Step 1 Clip the sling to both bolts and pull the  strands down so they are equal. Step 2 Pull the bottom of the sling around to  form a loop. Uses -  Step 3 Push the end of the sling through the  loop as shown.  Pull the knot tight. Step 4 This  forms  two  small  loops  beneath  the overhand knot. Clip a screwgate  through both  of these loops to  form  the central point. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 110 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nGirth Hitch (Lark’s Foot) Uses -  Attaching slings to your belay loop. -  Attaching slings together. Step 1 Feed a sling through your belay loop. Step 2 Put one end of the sling through the  other. Connecting  a  sling  to  a  carabiner  without opening the gate. -  Fastening a sling around a tree. -  Step 3 Pull it tight. Strop Bend You can also link two slings together  using these same steps. Arrange  the  girth  hitch  as  shown  below to create a strop bend. This is  basically a neater version of the girth  hitch. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 111 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nDouble Fisherman’s Bend Step 1 Loop  one  end  of  the  cord  around  twice as shown to create two loops.  Then  push  the  end  through  these  loops. Step 3 Pull it all tight so that the two knots  jam together. Make sure the tails are  at least 10 times the diameter of the  cord (e.g: 5cm tails for a 5mm prusik  cord). Step 2 Pull it tight and do the same with the  other end of the cord. Tying two ends of cord together to  make a prusik or cordelette. Triple Fisherman's Bend Add  an  extra  coil  to  make  a  triple  fisherman’s bend. Some  slippery  cords  (such  as  dyneema)  require  a  triple  so  they  don’t slide apart under load – check  the manufacturer’s recommendations. Uses -  VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 112 Spare cord Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStep 1 Wrap  the  prusik  neatly  around  the  rope a few times as shown. Step 2 Clip  the  ends  together  with  a  carabiner.  More  wraps  will  create more friction around the  ropes,  though  four  wraps  are  generally enough. Make sure the autoblock is neat  and  the  double  fisherman's  bend is away from the ropes. Step 3 Pinch  the  knot  to  loosen  it.  This  allows you to move it down the rope. Weight  the  knot  to  lock  it.  The  autoblock locks in both directions, but  the double fisherman's bend tends to  wrap  itself  into  the  prusik  when  the  direction is switched, making it much  less effective. The Autoblock (French) Prusik Uses: -  To back up an abseil. Prusiks  can  be  made  with  a  1.2m  length of 5mm cord tied together with  a double fisherman’s bend. A correctly  ggggggg tied prusik will auto-lock if you let go of  the  ropes.  Different  types  of  prusik  have advantages in certain situations.  These  are  detailed  in  The  Trad  Climber’s Guide To Problem Solving. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 113 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nDouble Bowline Uses -  Securing the end of a rope around a       large object such as a tree. -  Could also be used to tie the rope to       your harness. Step 1 Wrap  the  end  of  the  rope  around  a  tree  or  other  suitable  object.  Form  two  loops in the rope as shown. Step 2 Push the end of the rope up  through the two loops and  around  the  back  of  the  main strand. Then p ush the  end of the rope back down  through the loops. Step 3 Pass  the  end  around  the  back of the knot and push it  up through the new loop as  shown. Step 4 The double bowline is now  tied,  but  needs  a  stopper  knot to be complete. Pass  the end of the rope around  the main strand twice. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 114 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStep 5 Finish  the  stopper  knot  to  complete  the  double  bowline. Warning! The double bowline is great  for  tying  around  a  tree  or  boulder  as  part  of  a  top- rope anchor. Some climbers also use the  double bowline for tying in  because  it’s  easy  to  untie  after multiple falls. However,  it has been known to untie  itself, especially if the rope  is stiff. This is due to lots of  movement  in  the  rope  as  you  climb.  The  figure-8  is  recommended  as  a  much  safer  alternative  for  tying  into your harness.

But tying a 6mm tag  line to a 10.2mm rope with the same  knot will  probably result  in that knot  falling apart. Likewise,  a  knot  joining  an  old,  stiff  static rope to a slick, flexible dynamic  rope is likely to slip, even if they are  the same diameter. Figure-8 Tie In Uses The  figure-8  is  widely  accepted  as  being the safest knot to tie-in with. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 106 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStep 1 Make  a  loop  about  a  meter from the end of  the rope. Wrap the end  of the rope around the  base of the loop, then  push  the  end  through  as shown. Step 2 You should end up with  an  '8'.  Make  sure  the  knot  is  around  90cm  from  the  end  of  the  rope  (the  exact  length  varies  with  ropes  of  different diameters). Step 3 Pass the end of the rope  through  both  of the two  points  on  the  front  centre  of  your  harness  –  the  same  ones  your  belay loop runs through.  It  is  important  that  the  rope  goes  through  your  harness  in  exactly  the  same way as your belay  loop does. ~90cm Step 4 Use  the  end  of  the  rope  to  re-trace  the  figure-8.  Follow  the  twists  of  the  rope  starting  from where it  joins your harness. Step 6 Make  sure  the  tail  of  rope  is  around  25cm  long. If it is shorter, you'll  have  to  untie  and  start  again. After this, you will  need  to  tie  a  stopper  knot.  Loop  the  short  section  of  rope  around  the main length. Step 5 Continue  following  the  twists  until  you  end  up  back at the start of the  knot. Pull  the  whole  thing  tight. 2 5 c m VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 107 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStep 7 Do this twice, with the  second  loop  closer  to  you than the first. Step 8 Push  the  end  of  the  rope through these two  loops, as shown. Step 9 Pull this tight too (make  sure it's pushed right up  to your figure-8 knot). Figure-8 on a Bight Uses -  Attaching the rope to an anchor. Step 1 Take  a  bight  of  rope  and form an ‘8’ shape  as shown. Step 2 Push  the  end  of  the  rope  through  the  top  part of the 8. Step 3 Pull it tight. Creating  a  master  point  in  a  cordelette or sling. -  VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 108 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStopper Knot When tying a figure-8 in the end of a  rope,  make  sure  to  add  a  stopper  knot. Warning! Figure-8’s should only be end-loaded  (pulled along the line of the knot). If you load the loop in two opposing  directions, the knot can roll over itself  and lose strength or fail completely. For this reason, you should never use  the figure-8 to join ropes for abseiling. Step 1 Make  two  identical  loops  in  the  rope.  Put  the  rear  loop  over  the  top of the front loop. Step 2 Clip  a  screwgate  carabiner  (never  use  a  snapgate  carabiner)  through  these  two  loops. Step 3 Pull  it  tight  and  fasten  the screwgate. Clovehitch Uses -  Attaching yourself to the anchor. - Attaching  ropes,  cord  or  slings  to  carabiners. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 109 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nOverhand Loop Creating  a  master  point  in  a  cordelette or sling. Step 1 Clip the sling to both bolts and pull the  strands down so they are equal. Step 2 Pull the bottom of the sling around to  form a loop. Uses -  Step 3 Push the end of the sling through the  loop as shown.  Pull the knot tight. Step 4 This  forms  two  small  loops  beneath  the overhand knot. Clip a screwgate  through both  of these loops to  form  the central point. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 110 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nGirth Hitch (Lark’s Foot) Uses -  Attaching slings to your belay loop. -  Attaching slings together. Step 1 Feed a sling through your belay loop. Step 2 Put one end of the sling through the  other. Connecting  a  sling  to  a  carabiner  without opening the gate. -  Fastening a sling around a tree. -  Step 3 Pull it tight. Strop Bend You can also link two slings together  using these same steps. Arrange  the  girth  hitch  as  shown  below to create a strop bend. This is  basically a neater version of the girth  hitch. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 111 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nDouble Fisherman’s Bend Step 1 Loop  one  end  of  the  cord  around  twice as shown to create two loops.  Then  push  the  end  through  these  loops. Step 3 Pull it all tight so that the two knots  jam together. Make sure the tails are  at least 10 times the diameter of the  cord (e.g: 5cm tails for a 5mm prusik  cord). Step 2 Pull it tight and do the same with the  other end of the cord. Tying two ends of cord together to  make a prusik or cordelette. Triple Fisherman's Bend Add  an  extra  coil  to  make  a  triple  fisherman’s bend. Some  slippery  cords  (such  as  dyneema)  require  a  triple  so  they  don’t slide apart under load – check  the manufacturer’s recommendations. Uses -  VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 112 Spare cord Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStep 1 Wrap  the  prusik  neatly  around  the  rope a few times as shown. Step 2 Clip  the  ends  together  with  a  carabiner.  More  wraps  will  create more friction around the  ropes,  though  four  wraps  are  generally enough. Make sure the autoblock is neat  and  the  double  fisherman's  bend is away from the ropes. Step 3 Pinch  the  knot  to  loosen  it.  This  allows you to move it down the rope. Weight  the  knot  to  lock  it.  The  autoblock locks in both directions, but  the double fisherman's bend tends to  wrap  itself  into  the  prusik  when  the  direction is switched, making it much  less effective. The Autoblock (French) Prusik Uses: -  To back up an abseil. Prusiks  can  be  made  with  a  1.2m  length of 5mm cord tied together with  a double fisherman’s bend. A correctly  ggggggg tied prusik will auto-lock if you let go of  the  ropes.  Different  types  of  prusik  have advantages in certain situations.  These  are  detailed  in  The  Trad  Climber’s Guide To Problem Solving. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 113 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nDouble Bowline Uses -  Securing the end of a rope around a       large object such as a tree. -  Could also be used to tie the rope to       your harness. Step 1 Wrap  the  end  of  the  rope  around  a  tree  or  other  suitable  object.  Form  two  loops in the rope as shown. Step 2 Push the end of the rope up  through the two loops and  around  the  back  of  the  main strand. Then p ush the  end of the rope back down  through the loops. Step 3 Pass  the  end  around  the  back of the knot and push it  up through the new loop as  shown. Step 4 The double bowline is now  tied,  but  needs  a  stopper  knot to be complete. Pass  the end of the rope around  the main strand twice. VDiff > Sport Climbing Basics > Knots 114 Sold to mateo.gonzalez.gomez94@gmail.com \nStep 5 Finish  the  stopper  knot  to  complete  the  double  bowline. Warning! The double bowline is great  for  tying  around  a  tree  or  boulder  as  part  of  a  top- rope anchor. Some climbers also use the  double bowline for tying in  because  it’s  easy  to  untie  after multiple falls. However,  it has been known to untie  itself, especially if the rope  is stiff. This is due to lots of  movement  in  the  rope  as  you  climb.  The  figure-8  is  recommended  as  a  much  safer  alternative  for  tying  into your harness.
