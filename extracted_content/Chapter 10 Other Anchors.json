Forces  on  a  toprope  anchor  never  appr oach  those  possi­ ble  on  a  belay  anch or,  but  can  reach  500  pounds  or  more  due  to  the  addi tion  of  weight  from  the  belayer  and  dynamic  loading  in  the  syste m.  When  setti ng  top rope  anchor s,  keep  in  mind  the  following  conside rat ions:  •  Eva luate  any  hazards  at  the site,  especially  loose  rocks  that  the  movement  of  a  running  ro pe  could  dislodge.  •  Extend  the  anc hor s  over  the  edge  at  the  top of  the  clif f  to  pr event  rope drag  and  damage.  Profe ssional  guides  pr efer  to  rig  this  ext ension  with  a  length  of  static  rope.  Pad any  sharp  edges  at the  lip.  Mak e  sure  the rope  sits  dir ectly  abo ve  the  climb,  and  make  sur e  to  run  two  independe nt  str ands  of  rope  or  webbing  over  the  lip  to  maintain  redundanc y.  •  Set  the  chocks  and  SLCDs  fa irly  close  together  near  the  top  of  the  climb  when  possible  to  reduce  the  number  of  slin gs  and  car abiner s  required.  •  Avo id  setti ng  pieces  behind  detached  blocks,  flak es  or  other questionable  rock  features.  Also,  avoid  having  the  rope near  these  featu res.  •  Conne ct  the  rope  to  the  anchor s  with  two  opposed  car abiner s,  at  least  one  of  which is  locking.  If  a  spar e  locking  carab iner  isn't av ail able,  be  sure  the  gates  are  opposed,  and add  a  third  carabiner .  Climbing  schools  and outdoor  pr ograms  rou­ tinely  use  three  ovals  opposed  and  reversed  as  their  sta ndard  operating  proce­ dure,  as  do  a gro wing number  of  recre ational  clim bers.  I  have  done  my  shar e  of  toproping,  and  whe never  a  locking  carabiner  is  unavailable,  I  al ways  triple  the  car abiner s.  19 7  \n19 8  CL IMBING  AN CHOR S  \"Good  enough\"  toprope  anchor .

It's  more  fun  and  easier  to  watch  the  climber ,  and far  easier  to  micr o-fe ather  the  bela y  if  you  can  antici­ pate  fa lls.  (And  fa ll s  should  be  expected .  That's  the  very reason you  rig  a  toprope  in  the  fi rst  place.)  •  Avo id  belaying  dir ectly  below  the  climber ,  in  case  rocks  come  off.  Remember ,  though,  that the  force  in creases  as  you  move  away  fro m  the  wall,  or  if  the  climber  is  built  lik e  Mik e  Ty son  and  you're  a  slender  little  chap.  •  A gr ound  anchor  mer ely  needs  to  provide  extra  ballast  to  help  you  counterweight  the  climb er,  so  one  bomb proofpiece  is  usually  suff icient.  Know,  however ,  that  the  most  common  accident  at  Joshua  Tree  (one of  America's  most  popular  climbing  areas)  is  a  belayer  accident, where  the  be  layer  is  outweighed  by  the top  roped  clim ber ,  who  fa lls  and  dr ags the  belayer  roughshod  over  uneven  terr ain.  •  If  you're  in  an  exposed  situation  where  getti ng  yanked  from  your  ground  belay  would  be  di sastrous  or  even  fata l,  set  up  a  red undant  anchor  syste m.  Remember  that  an  anchor ed  be  layer is  a  sitting  duck  for  loose  rocks,  so  don't  lash  your self  down  in  a  shooting  gall ery.  200  CLIMBING  ANCHOR S  \nDon't  Be  Nonchalant  To prope  anchor s  do  pop  on  occasion.  Several  factors  contribute.  Ther e's  a  noncha­ lant  air  about  most  toproping, since,  in  theo ry,  it's a  relatively  harmless  vocation.  This  nonchalance  can  spill  over  to  the  anchor  setup. People  can  be  impatient  to get  cl imbing  and  get  lazy with the  one  th ing  that  truly  matters:  the  anchor .  The  most  common  danger  is  to  trust old  sl ings  on  a  long -st anding  top  rope  anchor - clippin g  into  the  slings,  rather  than  rigging  a  safe  setup  off  the  anchor s  themselves.  Not  good.  When  a  top  rope  anchor  fa ils,  it's a  very  ugly  affa ir .  Generally  ther e's  a  crowd  at  the  bottom,  eagerly waiting  their  turn.  All  eyes  are  on the  present  climb er.  He  pops  and  splashes  into  the  deck  at  your  very  feet. That  can  sour  the  sunnie st  day  at  the  most  enchanted  crag.  Ta ke  the  extra time and rig  it  right.  Th e  Te n-Point  Sy stem  An  inc reasing  number  of  beginn ers  are  taught  to create  good-enough  anchor s  through  a  st andardized,  criteria-based  method  called  the  Ten-Point  Syst em .  Because  beginn ers  often  top rope  climbs,  we  present  this  system  here.  In  basic  form,  it  works  lik e  this:  Hand-placed  primar y  placem ents  (nuts,  cams,  etc.)  ar e  assigned  a score  from  one  to  four . A  poor  nut,  for  instance,  receives a  one;  a  decent  cam that can  hold  much  of  its  maximal  load  will  be  given a three; a  no­ dou bt-about-it  taper  or  hex  in  an  ideal  bottl eneck  placement  li kely  gets  the  maxi­ mum  four .  The  onl y  primar y  placem ents  that  can  earn  five  points  are new  bolts  and  natural  anchor s  such  as  bombpr oof trees and blocks.  After  the  anchor s  are  set,  SRENE  is  applie d  per  the  rigging,  then  you  add  up  the  score  for  the primary  place­ ments.  If  you  at tain  a  score  of  ten  or  more,  your anchor  is  deemed  good  enough  and no  additional  pieces are  needed.  Of  cour se,  no  criteria  can  per fectly  guide  a  climb er's  judgment  in  awar ding  a  score  to  a given  placement,  and  one  climb er's  \"good  enough\"  might  rate  only  an  eight  or  nin e on  another  climb er's  scale.  Ne vert heless,  the  Te n-Point  System has  proven a  very  useful tool in  tea ching  begi nning  climbe rs  a  sense  of  what  is  good  enough,  wh ile  casting  doubt  on  most  all  two-p iece  anchor s  save  those  featu ring  bolts  or  bu rly  natural  features.  Her e's  a  str eamlined  ver sion  of  anchor s  that  sta nd  up  to  the  Te n-Po int  System  criteria:  •  One  tree;  •  Tw o  modern  bolts; or  •  Three  solid  pie ces,  plus  one  solid  piece  for  an  up ward  pull  if  you  ar e  buildin g a  belay  anchor  and  any  of  the  primary  placem ents are  not  omnidir ecti onal.  (Solid  means  the  piece  alone  would  likely  hold  a  worst-case  scenario  fa ll.  If  not,  equalize  it  with  an  additional  piece  or  pieces until the gr oupin g  meets  the  crit eria.)

Perhaps  the most  gruesome  of  all  climb ing  stories  is  the case  of  the  climber ,  high  on  a  big  wall,  ra ppelling  back  do wn  to  a  hanging bivouac  after  fixing  a  pitch.  He  raps off the  end  of  the rope and  windmills  down into  the  vo id.  Though this  has  hap­ pened,  it  is  extre mely  rare.  Far  mor e  fr equent  (though  st ill  ver y rare)  is  the  case  of  the  rappel  anchor  fa il ing.  Rappelling  is  probably  the  most  dang erous  procedur e  in  all  of  climbing , even  though  no  actual  climbing  is  involved.  For  this  reason  extreme  caution  should  alw ays  be  paid  to  every  rappel,  part icular ly  toward  the  anchor .  Rappelling  forces  you  to  rely  comp letely  on your  equipment  and  anchor s.  Wa lk ­ ing  is  usually  the  safest  mode  of  descent,  but  ra ppel  ling  may  be  necessa ry,  or  mor e  convenient.  Don't  take  any  chances  with  your  rappel  anchor s- they  must  also  conform  to  the  SRENE  concept.  Check  the  integr ity  of  existing  anc hor s.  Some­ times  rats  or  other  varmi nts  will  chew  on  fixed  webbing,  so check  the  entire  leng th  of  any  existing  sli ngs  in  the  sys tem.  Also,  aluminum  rappel  rings  can  be  worn  through,  especially  in  soft  sandstone  areas  (sand  gets in  ropes  and abrades the  aluminum  ring).  Always  inspect  the  rings, and  back them  up  when  possible.  The  rings  can  be  backed  up  with  a  second ring,  or  just  a  loop  of  webbing  that  the  rope  OT HER  ANCHORS  203  \nTwo  %-inch !Jolts  The  l<:!ft  bolt  hJs  a  stain­ less  steel  hang er,  then  a  !lteel  quick  link  tu  a  steel  lap  link  through  which  the  rope  1£  threaded  The  nght bolt  has  a  welded  cold  shut with  chain .

Back  up  existing  anchor s  if  you  have  any  question.  Don't  save  a  dollar and  be  a  mothe r's  lament.  At  least  two  bom bpr oof  anchor s  should  be  est abl ished  at  rappel  stat ions.  Occasionally  rappel  anchor s  consist  of  a  single  tree  or  set  of  sli ngs  on  a  rock  fea­ ture,  but  climbe rs  should  back  up  anc hor s  whene ver  possible.  Anchor s  should  be  rigged  using  equalized  sli ngs,  or  at  least  sli ngs  of  equal  length.  A  triangular  sling  configur ati on,  also  called  the  American triangle,  is some times  seen when  two  fixed  anc hor s  are  side  by  side -two  bolts  on  a  smooth  wa ll,  two  pitons  driven  into  a  hor izontal  crack,  etc.  There  probably  is  not  a  cl iff  in  America  that  doesn't  spor t  this  configuration,  most  lik ely as  a  popular ,  fixed  rappel  point.

Here  a sta ndar d  strategy  is  to  clip  a  backup  anchor  into  the  main anchor  so  that  when  the  main  is  weighted,  the  backup  st ill  has  a  few  inches  of  slack  in  the  sl ing.  The  biggest climber goes  fir st,  humping  all  the  gear  and  testi ng  the  main  anchor .  If  208  CLIMBING  ANCHOR S  \nit  holds,  the  second  clim ber , who  is  li ghter  and gear  free,  removes the  backup  and  raps  off.  Smooth  ra ppelling  basically  pl aces  a  low,  static  load  on  the  anch or.  But  when  you  start  Ra mboing  down  the  cl iffs ide  in  huge  arcs,  and  especially  when  you  slam  on  the  brakes  between  bounds,  the  forces  on the  anchor  can  skyrocket.  If the  anchor  is  less  than  1 0  ton  stro ng,  or  even  if it  is,  keep  the  forces  low by  tr ying  to  descend  fluidly  and  lig ht  as  a  feath er .  BI VOUAC  ANCHORS  If  you  are  bivouacked  on  a  ledge,  the  main  anchor  is  your  principal  secur ity,  though  you  often  will  slot  a co uple  of  reg ional  nuts  if  you'r e  sleeping  at  a  distance  from  the  anchor ,  or  at  a  place  where  you  can't  easily  ti e-off  taut  to  the  main anchor  (fo r  instance,  when  the  anchor  is  too  fa r  off  to  the  side) .  Unle ss  you'r e  litera lly  hanging  over  the  edge,  allo w  yourself  enough  slack  so  you  can  turn  over  in  your  bag, but  not  so  much  that  you  can  roll  off the  ledge.  Other  cons ider ations  have  to  be  worked  out  pr ovis ional ly.  It's  mainly  common  sense.  Hanging  bivouac s  can  get  complic ated,  depe ndin g  on  the  location  and  the  number  of  clim ber s  and  bags  you  have  along.  Since  por ta  ledges  came  into  vogue  around  19 80, the  process  has  been  greatly  simpli fied.  These  are  single -point  sus­ pension  units,  and  most  of  the  time  clim ber s  simpl y  ti er  them  one  above  the  other .  If  you're  all  on a  steep,  sheer  wa ll,  it's  simple -you  just  clip  off  to  the  haul  li ne  that  is  tied  to the  anchor .  But  if  you'r e  in  a  dih edral,  or  if  the  rock  is  peppered  with  roofs  or  other  features,  you  mi ght  have  to  spr ead  out  hor izontal ly.  In  these  situations,  most  clim ber s  will  climb  off  to  the side  and  place  a  provi sional  anchor  or  a  rivet  to  act uall y  sleep  fro m,  with  the  main  anchor  provi ding  the  real  secu rity.  Whatever  you're  sleeping  from,  make  sur e it's  bomber .  If  your  bi vy  anchor  fails,  you'r e  in  for a  horrifying  pl unge,  and  at  least  an  hour  of  grievous  cocking  around  to  get  things  right.  One  of  the  most  jack ass  fa ds  to  ever  sweep  Yo sem ite  Va lle y  passed  through  in  the  early  seventies.  I  don't  know what  bloc khead  conceiv ed  it,  but  for  a  while,  at  the  time  when  wa ll  climbing  was  the  rage,  it  was  the  vogue  to  see  just  how  meager  an  anchor  you  could hang from  for  the  ni ght.  Yo u  were  backed  up  by  an  absol utely  bombpr oof  anchor ,  of  cour se,  but  what  you  actually  were  hanging  from  was  as  dicey  as  you  were  foo li sh.  Let  me  relate  a  few  anecdo tes  to  show  how  asinine this game  was:  There  was  talk once  that  the  great  Ca nadian  wa ll  climber  Hugh Burton had  slept  hanging  from  a  Leeper  hook.  It  was twenty  year s  later that  he  told  me  he  hadn't  slept,  so  scared  was  he  to  even wink,  lest  the  hook pop and  his  reputati on  be  ru ined.

I was  with  Richard  Harrison,  who  sleeps  lik e  Meth uselah' s  father -d eep  and  sound;  but I've  alw ays  slept  lik e  I  was  on  deck  for  the  gas  chamb er,  more  so  when  hangi ng  from  a  harp  string  and  squashed  into  a  hammock  designed  for  people  skinny  enough  to  sho wer  inside  a  flagpole.  Who  could  ever  rea lly  saw  some  qual ity  logs  in  those  blas ted  ham mock s,  anyho w?  Not  me.  And  when  later that  sleeple ss  night Richard  farted,  or  a  carabiner sh ifte d, or  someth ing  caused  some  such  noise,  I  can  promise  you  Lazarus  did n't  vault  out  of  his  sarcophagus  any  faster  than  I  got  the  hell  out  of that  hammock  and  onto the  main  anch or.  That  fad  was  a  shor t-lived  one.  210  CLIM BING  ANCHORS  \nBIG  WALL  ANCHORS  One  of  the  di ffi culties  in  studying  big  wall  anchor s  is  in  photogr aphin g  them.  Or try­ ing  to.  On  a  genuine  big  wa ll,  so  much  equipment  (the  bulk  of  which  has  little  to  do  with  the  anchor)  is  on  hand  and the  clim ber s  are  so  close  to  the  wall  that  getting  a  clear  shot  of  the  anchor  is  nearly  impossible.  We  can  repl icate  systems  near  the  Climber s  on  Space Shot,  Zion  National  Park,  Utah,  one  of  the  great  big -w all  destination  climbing  areas.  PHOTO  BY  BOB  GAINES.  OTH ER  ANCHOR S  21 1  \nground,  but  they  are  not true  representations  of  what  you'll  lik ely  find  on a  wa ll.  The  business  of anc h oring  on  big  walls  is  a  special  study  taken  up  in  detail  in  Big  Wa lls!,  also  in  the How to  Clim b  series.  But  under stand  this  much: Big  walls  mean  big loads, which  means  equali zation is  all  the  more  impor tant;  and  big  wall  anchor s  are  complicated,  req uir ing  mor e  time  to  rig,  evaluate  and  to  make  sur e  things  are  as  they  should  be.  REVIEW  No  matter  the  part icular  anchor  constru ct- bivouac,  be lay,  toprope,  ra ppel -the  bottom  line  is  that  unl ess  you  make a  habit  of  climbing  on  junk  rock, or  have  a  pen­ chant  fo r  trashy  routes,  the  majo rity  of  your  anchor s  will  be  str aight forward  to  rig  and clean.  In real world  climbing  it  is  rare  that  an  experienced  leader  will  yell  do wn  \"Off  bela y\"  and not  yell  \"On  belay\"  within  a few  shor t  mi nutes,  the  belay  anchor  rigged  and  inviolate.  Keep  it  sim ple.  Ni ne  times  out  of  ten,  simpli city  equals  sa fety.  Experience  will  teach  you  much  about  building  belay  anchor s.  Alw ays  watch  for  inno vative  and  sli ck  setups  other  clim ber s  may  rig. You  are  never  too  old  to  learn  a  new  trick,  especially  if it  provides  an  easi er,  mor e  str aig htfo rward  method  of  deal­ ing  with  an  otherwise  complic ated  setup.  But  no  matter  how  simple  the  setup,  al ways  double -check  yo ur  par tner 's  work,  watch ing  for  poor  or  sloppy  anchor s.  Don't  be  afraid  to  insist on  better  anchor s  and  mor e  secur e  rigging  if things  look  slip shod.  Many  climber s  set  sketchy  an chors,  and  it's  up  to the  rest  of  us  to set  them  str aight  before  the Four  Horsemen  ga llop  into  vie w.  In  closing  let  me  reiter ate  that the  anchor  is  the  single  most  imp ortant  part  of  the  roped safety  syst em,  and  that  part  of  that  anchor  is the  fi rst  placement  off  the  bel ay,  the Jesus  Nut.  But  should  the  Jesus  Nut  fa il,  the  anchor  itself is  your  last  lin e  of  defense.  Remember  the  Golden  Rule:  The  anchor  must  be  able  to  sust ain  the  greatest  load  conceivable  in  a  given  instance,  or  it is  not  good  enough.  CONCL USION  From  choosing  the  indi vidual  placemen ts,  to  rigging  these into  a  power  point,  to  securing  the  Jesus  Nut  di rectly  off  the  bel ay,  anch or- building  choi ces  are so  varied  they  can  stagger  the  novice  and  stall  the  vete ra n.  With  so  many  options,  how  can  we  be  sur e  we'r e  building  goad-enough  anc hors, or  some th ing  less?  We  squar e  off  with  that  que stion  on  every  bel ay,  and  one  thing  remains  cer ta in:  without  solid  anchor s,  technical  climbing  is  a  swift  way  to  die.  The  fact  that  total  anchor  fa ilur e  happens  so  rarely -d espite  mill ions  of  clim ber s  sc alin g  mill ions  of  pitches  a  year ­ reassu res  us  either  that  build ing  secur e  anchor s  is  routinely  accomplished,  or  fac­ tor  2  fa lls  onto the  belay  are  extre mely  uncommon.  And in  those  rare  cases  of  catastr ophic  anchor  fa ilur e,  anal yses  suggest  that  the  majo rity  were  avoidable.  212  CLIMBING  ANCHOR S  \nWHEN  OV ERBUIL DIN G  IS  NECE SSARY  Se\"ersl  )'ears  ago,  on  i\"he  Dtreet  North  Butt ress  of  Middle  Cathedral  (one of  Amer ­ lt:\"a's  most  fabled long  free  climbs),  two  strong  clim bers  fell  to their deaths,  probably  from  the  uprer  ch1m neys  over  1, 000  feet  up  the  wal l.

Having  made  the  fourth  fre e  ascent  of  the  Dtrect  North  But tress ,  and  sever<:  I  for ays  onto  the  route  later  rm,  I  recall  many  places  where  a  leader  1s  fortunat\"'  to  arrangP.  any  protec tion  15  feet,  or  even  20  f�et,  off  the  belay .

While  ini tially  puzzl ing  and  comple x,  mastering  anchor - building  fundame ntals,  and  the  abil ity  to  fash ion  variations  on  the themes, naturally comes  with  time and  practice.  Most  experienced  climbe rs  can  qu ickly  tell  if  a  given  nut,  cam  or  anchor  is  good or  otherwise,  just  as  a  mason  can  tell  at  a  glance  if  the  bricks  have  been  proper ly  placed  and  mortar ed.  Sta ying  cu rrent  with the  lit erature,  and  taking  an  anchor  seminar ,  can  ra dically  incr ease  your  learning  cur ve  and  pr otection­ placing /anchor -b uilding  competence.  Every  ins tructor  will  have  favored  ways  of  doing  things,  but the  basic,  fiel d-tested  pr inci ples  will  be  the  very  ones  we  have  covered  in this  book .  Can  you  alw ays  quickly  and  sim ply  build  an  anch or?  No.  But  you can  and  should  strive  toward  simplici ty  and  effi cien cy,  avoiding  needless  sling s,  bine rs  and  garish  setups.  In  many  instances,  the  cordel ette-even  with  its  stated  lim itati ons - along  with  the  slidin g X  and  now  the  equale tte,  have  strea mlined  the  busine ss  of  rigging,  especially  where  the  plac em ents  are  spread  ar ound.  And  so  long  as  you  under ­ stand  that  a  sound  Jesus  Nut  pl aced  dir ectly  off  the  belay  is  crucial  to  keep  peak  forces  off  the  belay  anchor  itself,  you are  fa r  along  indeed .  In  closing,  let's  return  to  a  topic  mentioned  in the  introduction:  In  the  con text  of  technical  rock  climbing ,  what  does  secur e  really  mean?  Or  mor e  impor tantly ,  what  should  it  mean?  For  some,  secu rity  is  an  idea  blind  to  the  real life  demands  placed  on  clim ber s  attempting  to  scale  mu ltipitch  adventure  cli mbs.

Conf ormmg  an  anchor  to  the letter  of  every  sound  pnndple  does  not  guar antee  that  the  anchor will hold  a  single  pound .  The  best  rigging  can  do no  m o re  than exploit  the  potential  holding  !>trength  of  the  prm 1ary  pla cements .  l-Ienee  the  f1rst  rule  in  building  all  anchor s  is  to  get  sound  primary  placemen ts .  With  bomber primar y  place­ ments,  the  rules of thumb  and  modern  rigging  method:;  <;tack  the  odds  in  our  favor  that  the  anchor  will  do  1ts  job and  do  it  well .  orado  to  Chamonix,  time  and  equipm ent  are  variables  that must  be  managed  for  a  climbing  team  to  consis tently  ach ieve  success.  On  big routes,  simpl icity  and  effi­ cienc y- the  Tw in  Pil lars  of  this  text -must  extend  beyond  setti ng  pro  and building  anchors,  to  the  team's  modus oper andi.  In  alpine  setti ngs,  wher e  days  are  shor t  and storms  fr equent,  \"speed  equals  saf ety\"  is  a  common  refra in.  When,  in  the  name  of  sa fety,  a  climbing  team  wastes  time  and limi ted  resources,  at  some  place,  on  some  route,  the team  will  either  have  to  bail  or  rush the  process  up  high  to  compensate  for  time  squander ed  bel ow.  And  sometimes,  the  loss  in  time  was  due  to building  anchor s  that  exceeded  actual  need.  The  st andard  rati onal ization  for  over-bu ilding  belay  anchor s  is  that  an  anchor  is  never  too  strong.  An  extreme  view  on  this  wo uld  consider  ten  bolts  better  than  three.  Here,  appr eciation  for real  world  requir ements  gets  clouded  over  by  phobic  engineering  masquer ading  as  safety.  This view  also  fails  to  recognize  that  the  top  piece  of  pr otection  al ways  sust ain s  the  highe st  loading,  and  that  the  most  critical  job  is  to  rig  things  so  the  topmost  pro,  and  never  the  anchor  itself, catches  any  and  every  fall.  As  for  belay  an chors,  there  is  good  enough,  then  there  is  beyond  good  enough,  the  domain of  the  ideal,  the  per fect,  the  pur ely  theo reti cal.  Canadian  climber  Jeb  Stillman  recently  put  the subject  into  practical  context:  \"M ost  of  us  try  to  construct  anch ors  that  somewhat  exceed  the  standard  of  just  barely  good  enough.  Not  by  tons and  mile s,  but  by  some  acceptable  margin  that  provides  ade quate  peace  of  mind.  Beyo nd  building  an  anchor  that  will  hold,  most  experienced  climb ers  con­ sider  a  couple  possible  what-ifs,  then decide  if  it's  worth  the  tr ouble  of  addr essing  them  versus  their  actu al  lik eli hood  and  consequences.  Every  anchor  I  have  built  has been good  enough.  I'll  admit  that  the margin  has been  tighter  on  a  few,  but  clea rly,  every  single  one  exceeded  the  threshold  of  good  enough.  Those  of  us  who  can't  deter mine  'good  enough'  will  naturally  go  overboard  addin g  features  that  would,  in  theor y,  make  the  anchor  better .  But  at  some  point,  is  it  really?  I  mean,  if  the  question  is  whether  your  anchor  can  hold one  truck  or  three,  one  has  to  ask:  Are you  there  to  climb,  or  suspend  trucks?\"  214  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nThat  muc h  said,  ef ficiency  is  the  last  th ing  to  come when  learning  to  buil d  anchors.  In the early stages,  the  focus must  remain  on the  absolute  holding  power  and  the  secu rity  affo rded  by  the  rigging  of  your  anchors,  not  on  how  fast  you  can  build  them  or  how  much  gear  you  can  save  in the  pr ocess.  Be fore  you  truly  know  if your  anchor s  are  good  enough or  not,  it's  wise  to  build  anchor s  strong  enough to suspend  two  trucks,  instead  of  one.  Later  if  your ambi­ tion  dr ives  you  up  the  rungs  of  adventure  climbing ,  you  will  by  that  time  have  refi ned  yo ur  technique  to  the  point  that  you  can  settle  for  one  truck  anchor  str eng th,  which  you  can  fashion simply  and  ef ficie ntly.  And  you  wi ll  have  to  if  you're  ever  to  savor  the  spoils  of  adventure  climbin g.  At  some  time in your  climbing  career ,  be it  one  or  twenty years  into  it,  you'll  seriously  qu estion  why you are  climbing  at  all.  This  is  not hing  less  than  squaring  off  with  the  Main  Question  of  why are we  ali ve,  what  are  we  doing ,  wher e  are  we  going?  The  Main  Question  sneak s  into the co ntext  of  climbing  because,  well,  beca use  we' re  cli mbers.  And  every  climber  is  on  a  voyage  of  disc ove ry,  no  matter  how  uns tated  or  unconscious  the  voyage  mig ht  be. We  can  answer  the  Main  Ques­ tion  with  fancy  opinions  and  second-hand  bel iefs.  We  mi ght  even  thr ow  the  ques­ tion  back  on  itself, which  is  like  telling  God  to  ask  somebody  else.  I  reckon  any  meani ngful  response  fo ll ows  the  requirements  of  building  a  solid  anc hor .  In  fact,  your  answer  to  the  Main  Question  is  your  anchor  in  life,  and  in that  sense  your  pr i­ mary  placem ents  must  be  bom bproof  and  the  rigging  sim ply  and  effi ciently  arr ang ed .  The  noted  chef  Wolfgang  Puck  pr ofessed  his  own  anchor  matrix  in  a  sim­ ple  but  te lling  motto:  Live,  Love,  Eat.  For  many  of  us,  it's  Live,  Love,  and  Climb.  Per­ haps  the  Main  Question  bubbles  up  when  we  te mpor arily  misplace  the  first  two  place ments  in  the  matrix,  or  when  we're  belaying  off  only  the  th ir d,  instead  of  being  equali zed  between  all  three.  Everyo ne  must  answer  the  Main Que stion  in  their  own  way,  but  one  thing  remains  the same  for  us all:  To  see  this  great  voyage  of  disc overy  all  the  way  through,  we've  got  nothing  if  we  don't  ha ve  solid  anc hors.  We  come  to  the  cl iffs ide  to climb,  and  we  build  goad-enough  anc hors  and  immedia tely  slot  that  Jesus  Nut,  in  order  to  safeguard  our  lives.  Without  a  secur e  safety  system,  climbing  is  absurd.  And  without  effi cien cy,  climbin g  becomes  a  ploddi ng,  fear-based  sham.  Let  us  ne ver  forget  that the  safety  system was  devised  to  fa cil itate  climbi ng.  That's  the  name  of  the  game.  Climb  safe ly.  Climb  ef ficien tly.  Climb  on.

Forces  on  a  toprope  anchor  never  appr oach  those  possi­ ble  on  a  belay  anch or,  but  can  reach  500  pounds  or  more  due  to  the  addi tion  of  weight  from  the  belayer  and  dynamic  loading  in  the  syste m.  When  setti ng  top rope  anchor s,  keep  in  mind  the  following  conside rat ions:  •  Eva luate  any  hazards  at  the site,  especially  loose  rocks  that  the  movement  of  a  running  ro pe  could  dislodge.  •  Extend  the  anc hor s  over  the  edge  at  the  top of  the  clif f  to  pr event  rope drag  and  damage.  Profe ssional  guides  pr efer  to  rig  this  ext ension  with  a  length  of  static  rope.  Pad any  sharp  edges  at the  lip.  Mak e  sure  the rope  sits  dir ectly  abo ve  the  climb,  and  make  sur e  to  run  two  independe nt  str ands  of  rope  or  webbing  over  the  lip  to  maintain  redundanc y.  •  Set  the  chocks  and  SLCDs  fa irly  close  together  near  the  top  of  the  climb  when  possible  to  reduce  the  number  of  slin gs  and  car abiner s  required.  •  Avo id  setti ng  pieces  behind  detached  blocks,  flak es  or  other questionable  rock  features.  Also,  avoid  having  the  rope near  these  featu res.  •  Conne ct  the  rope  to  the  anchor s  with  two  opposed  car abiner s,  at  least  one  of  which is  locking.  If  a  spar e  locking  carab iner  isn't av ail able,  be  sure  the  gates  are  opposed,  and add  a  third  carabiner .

    "5": "Don't  Be  Nonchalant  To prope  anchor s  do  pop  on  occasion.  Several  factors  contribute.  Ther e's  a  noncha­ lant  air  about  most  toproping, since,  in  theo ry,  it's a  relatively  harmless  vocation.  This  nonchalance  can  spill  over  to  the  anchor  setup. People  can  be  impatient  to get  cl imbing  and  get  lazy with the  one  th ing  that  truly  matters:  the  anchor .  The  most  common  danger  is  to  trust old  sl ings  on  a  long -st anding  top  rope  anchor - clippin g  into  the  slings,  rather  than  rigging  a  safe  setup  off  the  anchor s  themselves.  Not  good.  When  a  top  rope  anchor  fa ils,  it's a  very  ugly  affa ir .  Generally  ther e's  a  crowd  at  the  bottom,  eagerly waiting  their  turn.  All  eyes  are  on the  present  climb er.  He  pops  and  splashes  into  the  deck  at  your  very  feet. That  can  sour  the  sunnie st  day  at  the  most  enchanted  crag.  Ta ke  the  extra time and rig  it  right.  Th e  Te n-Point  Sy stem  An  inc reasing  number  of  beginn ers  are  taught  to create  good-enough  anchor s  through  a  st andardized,  criteria-based  method  called  the  Ten-Point  Syst em .  Because  beginn ers  often  top rope  climbs,  we  present  this  system  here.  In  basic  form,  it  works  lik e  this:  Hand-placed  primar y  placem ents  (nuts,  cams,  etc.)  ar e  assigned  a score  from  one  to  four . A  poor  nut,  for  instance,  receives a  one;  a  decent  cam that can  hold  much  of  its  maximal  load  will  be  given a three; a  no­ dou bt-about-it  taper  or  hex  in  an  ideal  bottl eneck  placement  li kely  gets  the  maxi­ mum  four .  The  onl y  primar y  placem ents  that  can  earn  five  points  are new  bolts  and  natural  anchor s  such  as  bombpr oof trees and blocks.  After  the  anchor s  are  set,  SRENE  is  applie d  per  the  rigging,  then  you  add  up  the  score  for  the primary  place­ ments.  If  you  at tain  a  score  of  ten  or  more,  your anchor  is  deemed  good  enough  and no  additional  pieces are  needed.  Of  cour se,  no  criteria  can  per fectly  guide  a  climb er's  judgment  in  awar ding  a  score  to  a given  placement,  and  one  climb er's  \"good  enough\"  might  rate  only  an  eight  or  nin e on  another  climb er's  scale.  Ne vert heless,  the  Te n-Point  System has  proven a  very  useful tool in  tea ching  begi nning  climbe rs  a  sense  of  what  is  good  enough,  wh ile  casting  doubt  on  most  all  two-p iece  anchor s  save  those  featu ring  bolts  or  bu rly  natural  features.  Her e's  a  str eamlined  ver sion  of  anchor s  that  sta nd  up  to  the  Te n-Po int  System  criteria:  •  One  tree;  •  Tw o  modern  bolts; or  •  Three  solid  pie ces,  plus  one  solid  piece  for  an  up ward  pull  if  you  ar e  buildin g a  belay  anchor  and  any  of  the  primary  placem ents are  not  omnidir ecti onal.  (Solid  means  the  piece  alone  would  likely  hold  a  worst-case  scenario  fa ll.  If  not,  equalize  it  with  an  additional  piece  or  pieces until the gr oupin g  meets  the  crit eria.)

Unle ss  you'r e  litera lly  hanging  over  the  edge,  allo w  yourself  enough  slack  so  you  can  turn  over  in  your  bag, but  not  so  much  that  you  can  roll  off the  ledge.  Other  cons ider ations  have  to  be  worked  out  pr ovis ional ly.  It's  mainly  common  sense.  Hanging  bivouac s  can  get  complic ated,  depe ndin g  on  the  location  and  the  number  of  clim ber s  and  bags  you  have  along.  Since  por ta  ledges  came  into  vogue  around  19 80, the  process  has  been  greatly  simpli fied.  These  are  single -point  sus­ pension  units,  and  most  of  the  time  clim ber s  simpl y  ti er  them  one  above  the  other .  If  you're  all  on a  steep,  sheer  wa ll,  it's  simple -you  just  clip  off  to  the  haul  li ne  that  is  tied  to the  anchor .  But  if  you'r e  in  a  dih edral,  or  if  the  rock  is  peppered  with  roofs  or  other  features,  you  mi ght  have  to  spr ead  out  hor izontal ly.  In  these  situations,  most  clim ber s  will  climb  off  to  the side  and  place  a  provi sional  anchor  or  a  rivet  to  act uall y  sleep  fro m,  with  the  main  anchor  provi ding  the  real  secu rity.  Whatever  you're  sleeping  from,  make  sur e it's  bomber .  If  your  bi vy  anchor  fails,  you'r e  in  for a  horrifying  pl unge,  and  at  least  an  hour  of  grievous  cocking  around  to  get  things  right.  One  of  the  most  jack ass  fa ds  to  ever  sweep  Yo sem ite  Va lle y  passed  through  in  the  early  seventies.  I  don't  know what  bloc khead  conceiv ed  it,  but  for  a  while,  at  the  time  when  wa ll  climbing  was  the  rage,  it  was  the  vogue  to  see  just  how  meager  an  anchor  you  could hang from  for  the  ni ght.  Yo u  were  backed  up  by  an  absol utely  bombpr oof  anchor ,  of  cour se,  but  what  you  actually  were  hanging  from  was  as  dicey  as  you  were  foo li sh.

The  business  of anc h oring  on  big  walls  is  a  special  study  taken  up  in  detail  in  Big  Wa lls!,  also  in  the How to  Clim b  series.  But  under stand  this  much: Big  walls  mean  big loads, which  means  equali zation is  all  the  more  impor tant;  and  big  wall  anchor s  are  complicated,  req uir ing  mor e  time  to  rig,  evaluate  and  to  make  sur e  things  are  as  they  should  be.  REVIEW  No  matter  the  part icular  anchor  constru ct- bivouac,  be lay,  toprope,  ra ppel -the  bottom  line  is  that  unl ess  you  make a  habit  of  climbing  on  junk  rock, or  have  a  pen­ chant  fo r  trashy  routes,  the  majo rity  of  your  anchor s  will  be  str aight forward  to  rig  and clean.  In real world  climbing  it  is  rare  that  an  experienced  leader  will  yell  do wn  \"Off  bela y\"  and not  yell  \"On  belay\"  within  a few  shor t  mi nutes,  the  belay  anchor  rigged  and  inviolate.  Keep  it  sim ple.  Ni ne  times  out  of  ten,  simpli city  equals  sa fety.  Experience  will  teach  you  much  about  building  belay  anchor s.  Alw ays  watch  for  inno vative  and  sli ck  setups  other  clim ber s  may  rig. You  are  never  too  old  to  learn  a  new  trick,  especially  if it  provides  an  easi er,  mor e  str aig htfo rward  method  of  deal­ ing  with  an  otherwise  complic ated  setup.  But  no  matter  how  simple  the  setup,  al ways  double -check  yo ur  par tner 's  work,  watch ing  for  poor  or  sloppy  anchor s.  Don't  be  afraid  to  insist on  better  anchor s  and  mor e  secur e  rigging  if things  look  slip shod.  Many  climber s  set  sketchy  an chors,  and  it's  up  to the  rest  of  us  to set  them  str aight  before  the Four  Horsemen  ga llop  into  vie w.  In  closing  let  me  reiter ate  that the  anchor  is  the  single  most  imp ortant  part  of  the  roped safety  syst em,  and  that  part  of  that  anchor  is the  fi rst  placement  off  the  bel ay,  the Jesus  Nut.  But  should  the  Jesus  Nut  fa il,  the  anchor  itself is  your  last  lin e  of  defense.  Remember  the  Golden  Rule:  The  anchor  must  be  able  to  sust ain  the  greatest  load  conceivable  in  a  given  instance,  or  it is  not  good  enough.  CONCL USION  From  choosing  the  indi vidual  placemen ts,  to  rigging  these into  a  power  point,  to  securing  the  Jesus  Nut  di rectly  off  the  bel ay,  anch or- building  choi ces  are so  varied  they  can  stagger  the  novice  and  stall  the  vete ra n.  With  so  many  options,  how  can  we  be  sur e  we'r e  building  goad-enough  anc hors, or  some th ing  less?  We  squar e  off  with  that  que stion  on  every  bel ay,  and  one  thing  remains  cer ta in:  without  solid  anchor s,  technical  climbing  is  a  swift  way  to  die.  The  fact  that  total  anchor  fa ilur e  happens  so  rarely -d espite  mill ions  of  clim ber s  sc alin g  mill ions  of  pitches  a  year ­ reassu res  us  either  that  build ing  secur e  anchor s  is  routinely  accomplished,  or  fac­ tor  2  fa lls  onto the  belay  are  extre mely  uncommon.

Most  experienced  climbe rs  can  qu ickly  tell  if  a  given  nut,  cam  or  anchor  is  good or  otherwise,  just  as  a  mason  can  tell  at  a  glance  if  the  bricks  have  been  proper ly  placed  and  mortar ed.

Every  ins tructor  will  have  favored  ways  of  doing  things,  but the  basic,  fiel d-tested  pr inci ples  will  be  the  very  ones  we  have  covered  in this  book .  Can  you  alw ays  quickly  and  sim ply  build  an  anch or?  No.  But  you can  and  should  strive  toward  simplici ty  and  effi cien cy,  avoiding  needless  sling s,  bine rs  and  garish  setups.  In  many  instances,  the  cordel ette-even  with  its  stated  lim itati ons - along  with  the  slidin g X  and  now  the  equale tte,  have  strea mlined  the  busine ss  of  rigging,  especially  where  the  plac em ents  are  spread  ar ound.  And  so  long  as  you  under ­ stand  that  a  sound  Jesus  Nut  pl aced  dir ectly  off  the  belay  is  crucial  to  keep  peak  forces  off  the  belay  anchor  itself,  you are  fa r  along  indeed .

On  big routes,  simpl icity  and  effi­ cienc y- the  Tw in  Pil lars  of  this  text -must  extend  beyond  setti ng  pro  and building  anchors,  to  the  team's  modus oper andi.  In  alpine  setti ngs,  wher e  days  are  shor t  and storms  fr equent,  \"speed  equals  saf ety\"  is  a  common  refra in.  When,  in  the  name  of  sa fety,  a  climbing  team  wastes  time  and limi ted  resources,  at  some  place,  on  some  route,  the team  will  either  have  to  bail  or  rush the  process  up  high  to  compensate  for  time  squander ed  bel ow.  And  sometimes,  the  loss  in  time  was  due  to building  anchor s  that  exceeded  actual  need.  The  st andard  rati onal ization  for  over-bu ilding  belay  anchor s  is  that  an  anchor  is  never  too  strong.  An  extreme  view  on  this  wo uld  consider  ten  bolts  better  than  three.  Here,  appr eciation  for real  world  requir ements  gets  clouded  over  by  phobic  engineering  masquer ading  as  safety.  This view  also  fails  to  recognize  that  the  top  piece  of  pr otection  al ways  sust ain s  the  highe st  loading,  and  that  the  most  critical  job  is  to  rig  things  so  the  topmost  pro,  and  never  the  anchor  itself, catches  any  and  every  fall.  As  for  belay  an chors,  there  is  good  enough,  then  there  is  beyond  good  enough,  the  domain of  the  ideal,  the  per fect,  the  pur ely  theo reti cal.  Canadian  climber  Jeb  Stillman  recently  put  the subject  into  practical  context:  \"M ost  of  us  try  to  construct  anch ors  that  somewhat  exceed  the  standard  of  just  barely  good  enough.  Not  by  tons and  mile s,  but  by  some  acceptable  margin  that  provides  ade quate  peace  of  mind.  Beyo nd  building  an  anchor  that  will  hold,  most  experienced  climb ers  con­ sider  a  couple  possible  what-ifs,  then decide  if  it's  worth  the  tr ouble  of  addr essing  them  versus  their  actu al  lik eli hood  and  consequences.  Every  anchor  I  have  built  has been good  enough.  I'll  admit  that  the margin  has been  tighter  on  a  few,  but  clea rly,  every  single  one  exceeded  the  threshold  of  good  enough.  Those  of  us  who  can't  deter mine  'good  enough'  will  naturally  go  overboard  addin g  features  that  would,  in  theor y,  make  the  anchor  better .  But  at  some  point,  is  it  really?  I  mean,  if  the  question  is  whether  your  anchor  can  hold one  truck  or  three,  one  has  to  ask:  Are you  there  to  climb,  or  suspend  trucks?\"  214  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  ",
    "19": "That  muc h  said,  ef ficiency  is  the  last  th ing  to  come when  learning  to  buil d  anchors.  In the early stages,  the  focus must  remain  on the  absolute  holding  power  and  the  secu rity  affo rded  by  the  rigging  of  your  anchors,  not  on  how  fast  you  can  build  them  or  how  much  gear  you  can  save  in the  pr ocess.  Be fore  you  truly  know  if your  anchor s  are  good  enough or  not,  it's  wise  to  build  anchor s  strong  enough to suspend  two  trucks,  instead  of  one.  Later  if  your ambi­ tion  dr ives  you  up  the  rungs  of  adventure  climbing ,  you  will  by  that  time  have  refi ned  yo ur  technique  to  the  point  that  you  can  settle  for  one  truck  anchor  str eng th,  which  you  can  fashion simply  and  ef ficie ntly.  And  you  wi ll  have  to  if  you're  ever  to  savor  the  spoils  of  adventure  climbin g.  At  some  time in your  climbing  career ,  be it  one  or  twenty years  into  it,  you'll  seriously  qu estion  why you are  climbing  at  all.  This  is  not hing  less  than  squaring  off  with  the  Main  Question  of  why are we  ali ve,  what  are  we  doing ,  wher e  are  we  going?  The  Main  Question  sneak s  into the co ntext  of  climbing  because,  well,  beca use  we' re  cli mbers.  And  every  climber  is  on  a  voyage  of  disc ove ry,  no  matter  how  uns tated  or  unconscious  the  voyage  mig ht  be. We  can  answer  the  Main  Ques­ tion  with  fancy  opinions  and  second-hand  bel iefs.  We  mi ght  even  thr ow  the  ques­ tion  back  on  itself, which  is  like  telling  God  to  ask  somebody  else.  I  reckon  any  meani ngful  response  fo ll ows  the  requirements  of  building  a  solid  anc hor .  In  fact,  your  answer  to  the  Main  Question  is  your  anchor  in  life,  and  in that  sense  your  pr i­ mary  placem ents  must  be  bom bproof  and  the  rigging  sim ply  and  effi ciently  arr ang ed .  The  noted  chef  Wolfgang  Puck  pr ofessed  his  own  anchor  matrix  in  a  sim­ ple  but  te lling  motto:  Live,  Love,  Eat.  For  many  of  us,  it's  Live,  Love,  and  Climb.  Per­ haps  the  Main  Question  bubbles  up  when  we  te mpor arily  misplace  the  first  two  place ments  in  the  matrix,  or  when  we're  belaying  off  only  the  th ir d,  instead  of  being  equali zed  between  all  three.  Everyo ne  must  answer  the  Main Que stion  in  their  own  way,  but  one  thing  remains  the same  for  us all:  To  see  this  great  voyage  of  disc overy  all  the  way  through,  we've  got  nothing  if  we  don't  ha ve  solid  anc hors.  We  come  to  the  cl iffs ide  to climb,  and  we  build  goad-enough  anc hors  and  immedia tely  slot  that  Jesus  Nut,  in  order  to  safeguard  our  lives.  Without  a  secur e  safety  system,  climbing  is  absurd.  And  without  effi cien cy,  climbin g  becomes  a  ploddi ng,  fear-based  sham.  Let  us  ne ver  forget  that the  safety  system was  devised  to  fa cil itate  climbi ng.  That's  the  name  of  the  game.  Climb  safe ly.  Climb  ef ficien tly.  Climb  on.

Forces  on  a  toprope  anchor  never  appr oach  those  possi­ ble  on  a  belay  anch or,  but  can  reach  500  pounds  or  more  due  to  the  addi tion  of  weight  from  the  belayer  and  dynamic  loading  in  the  syste m.

Know,  however ,  that  the  most  common  accident  at  Joshua  Tree  (one of  America's  most  popular  climbing  areas)  is  a  belayer  accident, where  the  be  layer  is  outweighed  by  the top  roped  clim ber ,  who  fa lls  and  dr ags the  belayer  roughshod  over  uneven  terr ain.  •  If  you're  in  an  exposed  situation  where  getti ng  yanked  from  your  ground  belay  would  be  di sastrous  or  even  fata l,  set  up  a  red undant  anchor  syste m.

Several  factors  contribute.  Ther e's  a  noncha­ lant  air  about  most  toproping, since,  in  theo ry,  it's a  relatively  harmless  vocation.  This  nonchalance  can  spill  over  to  the  anchor  setup. People  can  be  impatient  to get  cl imbing  and  get  lazy with the  one  th ing  that  truly  matters:  the  anchor .  The  most  common  danger  is  to  trust old  sl ings  on  a  long -st anding  top  rope  anchor - clippin g  into  the  slings,  rather  than  rigging  a  safe  setup  off  the  anchor s  themselves.  Not  good.  When  a  top  rope  anchor  fa ils,  it's a  very  ugly  affa ir .  Generally  ther e's  a  crowd  at  the  bottom,  eagerly waiting  their  turn.  All  eyes  are  on the  present  climb er.  He  pops  and  splashes  into  the  deck  at  your  very  feet. That  can  sour  the  sunnie st  day  at  the  most  enchanted  crag.  Ta ke  the  extra time and rig  it  right.  Th e  Te n-Point  Sy stem  An  inc reasing  number  of  beginn ers  are  taught  to create  good-enough  anchor s  through  a  st andardized,  criteria-based  method  called  the  Ten-Point  Syst em .  Because  beginn ers  often  top rope  climbs,  we  present  this  system  here.  In  basic  form,  it  works  lik e  this:  Hand-placed  primar y  placem ents  (nuts,  cams,  etc.)  ar e  assigned  a score  from  one  to  four . A  poor  nut,  for  instance,  receives a  one;  a  decent  cam that can  hold  much  of  its  maximal  load  will  be  given a three; a  no­ dou bt-about-it  taper  or  hex  in  an  ideal  bottl eneck  placement  li kely  gets  the  maxi­ mum  four .  The  onl y  primar y  placem ents  that  can  earn  five  points  are new  bolts  and  natural  anchor s  such  as  bombpr oof trees and blocks.  After  the  anchor s  are  set,  SRENE  is  applie d  per  the  rigging,  then  you  add  up  the  score  for  the primary  place­ ments.  If  you  at tain  a  score  of  ten  or  more,  your anchor  is  deemed  good  enough  and no  additional  pieces are  needed.  Of  cour se,  no  criteria  can  per fectly  guide  a  climb er's  judgment  in  awar ding  a  score  to  a given  placement,  and  one  climb er's  \"good  enough\"  might  rate  only  an  eight  or  nin e on  another  climb er's  scale.  Ne vert heless,  the  Te n-Point  System has  proven a  very  useful tool in  tea ching  begi nning  climbe rs  a  sense  of  what  is  good  enough,  wh ile  casting  doubt  on  most  all  two-p iece  anchor s  save  those  featu ring  bolts  or  bu rly  natural  features.  Her e's  a  str eamlined  ver sion  of  anchor s  that  sta nd  up  to  the  Te n-Po int  System  criteria:  •  One  tree;  •  Tw o  modern  bolts; or  •  Three  solid  pie ces,  plus  one  solid  piece  for  an  up ward  pull  if  you  ar e  buildin g a  belay  anchor  and  any  of  the  primary  placem ents are  not  omnidir ecti onal.  (Solid  means  the  piece  alone  would  likely  hold  a  worst-case  scenario  fa ll.  If  not,  equalize  it  with  an  additional  piece  or  pieces until the gr oupin g  meets  the  crit eria.)

Perhaps  the most  gruesome  of  all  climb ing  stories  is  the case  of  the  climber ,  high  on  a  big  wall,  ra ppelling  back  do wn  to  a  hanging bivouac  after  fixing  a  pitch.  He  raps off the  end  of  the rope and  windmills  down into  the  vo id.  Though this  has  hap­ pened,  it  is  extre mely  rare.  Far  mor e  fr equent  (though  st ill  ver y rare)  is  the  case  of  the  rappel  anchor  fa il ing.  Rappelling  is  probably  the  most  dang erous  procedur e  in  all  of  climbing , even  though  no  actual  climbing  is  involved.  For  this  reason  extreme  caution  should  alw ays  be  paid  to  every  rappel,  part icular ly  toward  the  anchor .  Rappelling  forces  you  to  rely  comp letely  on your  equipment  and  anchor s.  Wa lk ­ ing  is  usually  the  safest  mode  of  descent,  but  ra ppel  ling  may  be  necessa ry,  or  mor e  convenient.  Don't  take  any  chances  with  your  rappel  anchor s- they  must  also  conform  to  the  SRENE  concept.  Check  the  integr ity  of  existing  anc hor s.

Also,  aluminum  rappel  rings  can  be  worn  through,  especially  in  soft  sandstone  areas  (sand  gets in  ropes  and abrades the  aluminum  ring).  Always  inspect  the  rings, and  back them  up  when  possible.

Anchor s  should  be  rigged  using  equalized  sli ngs,  or  at  least  sli ngs  of  equal  length.  A  triangular  sling  configur ati on,  also  called  the  American triangle,  is some times  seen when  two  fixed  anc hor s  are  side  by  side -two  bolts  on  a  smooth  wa ll,  two  pitons  driven  into  a  hor izontal  crack,  etc.  There  probably  is  not  a  cl iff  in  America  that  doesn't  spor t  this  configuration,  most  lik ely as  a  popular ,  fixed  rappel  point.

Here  a sta ndar d  strategy  is  to  clip  a  backup  anchor  into  the  main anchor  so  that  when  the  main  is  weighted,  the  backup  st ill  has  a  few  inches  of  slack  in  the  sl ing.

But  when  you  start  Ra mboing  down  the  cl iffs ide  in  huge  arcs,  and  especially  when  you  slam  on  the  brakes  between  bounds,  the  forces  on the  anchor  can  skyrocket.

BI VOUAC  ANCHORS  If  you  are  bivouacked  on  a  ledge,  the  main  anchor  is  your  principal  secur ity,  though  you  often  will  slot  a co uple  of  reg ional  nuts  if  you'r e  sleeping  at  a  distance  from  the  anchor ,  or  at  a  place  where  you  can't  easily  ti e-off  taut  to  the  main anchor  (fo r  instance,  when  the  anchor  is  too  fa r  off  to  the  side) .

Other  cons ider ations  have  to  be  worked  out  pr ovis ional ly.  It's  mainly  common  sense.  Hanging  bivouac s  can  get  complic ated,  depe ndin g  on  the  location  and  the  number  of  clim ber s  and  bags  you  have  along.  Since  por ta  ledges  came  into  vogue  around  19 80, the  process  has  been  greatly  simpli fied.

I  don't  know what  bloc khead  conceiv ed  it,  but  for  a  while,  at  the  time  when  wa ll  climbing  was  the  rage,  it  was  the  vogue  to  see  just  how  meager  an  anchor  you  could hang from  for  the  ni ght.  Yo u  were  backed  up  by  an  absol utely  bombpr oof  anchor ,  of  cour se,  but  what  you  actually  were  hanging  from  was  as  dicey  as  you  were  foo li sh.  Let  me  relate  a  few  anecdo tes  to  show  how  asinine this game  was:  There  was  talk once  that  the  great  Ca nadian  wa ll  climber  Hugh Burton had  slept  hanging  from  a  Leeper  hook.  It  was twenty  year s  later that  he  told  me  he  hadn't  slept,  so  scared  was  he  to  even wink,  lest  the  hook pop and  his  reputati on  be  ru ined.  For  my  own  part,  I  can  re member  being  ha lfway  up  a  new  li ne  in  the  Sie rras  and  slinging  my  OT HER  ANC HOR S  209  \nScott  Cosgrove  hanging  out on  his porta  ledge,  Higher  Cathedral  Spire,  Yo semite,  California.

I was  with  Richard  Harrison,  who  sleeps  lik e  Meth uselah' s  father -d eep  and  sound;  but I've  alw ays  slept  lik e  I  was  on  deck  for  the  gas  chamb er,  more  so  when  hangi ng  from  a  harp  string  and  squashed  into  a  hammock  designed  for  people  skinny  enough  to  sho wer  inside  a  flagpole.  Who  could  ever  rea lly  saw  some  qual ity  logs  in  those  blas ted  ham mock s,  anyho w?  Not  me.  And  when  later that  sleeple ss  night Richard  farted,  or  a  carabiner sh ifte d, or  someth ing  caused  some  such  noise,  I  can  promise  you  Lazarus  did n't  vault  out  of  his  sarcophagus  any  faster  than  I  got  the  hell  out  of that  hammock  and  onto the  main  anch or.  That  fad  was  a  shor t-lived  one.  210  CLIM BING  ANCHORS  \nBIG  WALL  ANCHORS  One  of  the  di ffi culties  in  studying  big  wall  anchor s  is  in  photogr aphin g  them.  Or try­ ing  to.  On  a  genuine  big  wa ll,  so  much  equipment  (the  bulk  of  which  has  little  to  do  with  the  anchor)  is  on  hand  and the  clim ber s  are  so  close  to  the  wall  that  getting  a  clear  shot  of  the  anchor  is  nearly  impossible.  We  can  repl icate  systems  near  the  Climber s  on  Space Shot,  Zion  National  Park,  Utah,  one  of  the  great  big -w all  destination  climbing  areas.  PHOTO  BY  BOB  GAINES.  OTH ER  ANCHOR S  21 1  \nground,  but  they  are  not true  representations  of  what  you'll  lik ely  find  on a  wa ll.  The  business  of anc h oring  on  big  walls  is  a  special  study  taken  up  in  detail  in  Big  Wa lls!,  also  in  the How to  Clim b  series.  But  under stand  this  much: Big  walls  mean  big loads, which  means  equali zation is  all  the  more  impor tant;  and  big  wall  anchor s  are  complicated,  req uir ing  mor e  time  to  rig,  evaluate  and  to  make  sur e  things  are  as  they  should  be.  REVIEW  No  matter  the  part icular  anchor  constru ct- bivouac,  be lay,  toprope,  ra ppel -the  bottom  line  is  that  unl ess  you  make a  habit  of  climbing  on  junk  rock, or  have  a  pen­ chant  fo r  trashy  routes,  the  majo rity  of  your  anchor s  will  be  str aight forward  to  rig  and clean.  In real world  climbing  it  is  rare  that  an  experienced  leader  will  yell  do wn  \"Off  bela y\"  and not  yell  \"On  belay\"  within  a few  shor t  mi nutes,  the  belay  anchor  rigged  and  inviolate.  Keep  it  sim ple.  Ni ne  times  out  of  ten,  simpli city  equals  sa fety.  Experience  will  teach  you  much  about  building  belay  anchor s.  Alw ays  watch  for  inno vative  and  sli ck  setups  other  clim ber s  may  rig. You  are  never  too  old  to  learn  a  new  trick,  especially  if it  provides  an  easi er,  mor e  str aig htfo rward  method  of  deal­ ing  with  an  otherwise  complic ated  setup.  But  no  matter  how  simple  the  setup,  al ways  double -check  yo ur  par tner 's  work,  watch ing  for  poor  or  sloppy  anchor s.  Don't  be  afraid  to  insist on  better  anchor s  and  mor e  secur e  rigging  if things  look  slip shod.  Many  climber s  set  sketchy  an chors,  and  it's  up  to the  rest  of  us  to set  them  str aight  before  the Four  Horsemen  ga llop  into  vie w.  In  closing  let  me  reiter ate  that the  anchor  is  the  single  most  imp ortant  part  of  the  roped safety  syst em,  and  that  part  of  that  anchor  is the  fi rst  placement  off  the  bel ay,  the Jesus  Nut.  But  should  the  Jesus  Nut  fa il,  the  anchor  itself is  your  last  lin e  of  defense.  Remember  the  Golden  Rule:  The  anchor  must  be  able  to  sust ain  the  greatest  load  conceivable  in  a  given  instance,  or  it is  not  good  enough.  CONCL USION  From  choosing  the  indi vidual  placemen ts,  to  rigging  these into  a  power  point,  to  securing  the  Jesus  Nut  di rectly  off  the  bel ay,  anch or- building  choi ces  are so  varied  they  can  stagger  the  novice  and  stall  the  vete ra n.  With  so  many  options,  how  can  we  be  sur e  we'r e  building  goad-enough  anc hors, or  some th ing  less?  We  squar e  off  with  that  que stion  on  every  bel ay,  and  one  thing  remains  cer ta in:  without  solid  anchor s,  technical  climbing  is  a  swift  way  to  die.  The  fact  that  total  anchor  fa ilur e  happens  so  rarely -d espite  mill ions  of  clim ber s  sc alin g  mill ions  of  pitches  a  year ­ reassu res  us  either  that  build ing  secur e  anchor s  is  routinely  accomplished,  or  fac­ tor  2  fa lls  onto the  belay  are  extre mely  uncommon.  And in  those  rare  cases  of  catastr ophic  anchor  fa ilur e,  anal yses  suggest  that  the  majo rity  were  avoidable.  212  CLIMBING  ANCHOR S  \nWHEN  OV ERBUIL DIN G  IS  NECE SSARY  Se\"ersl  )'ears  ago,  on  i\"he  Dtreet  North  Butt ress  of  Middle  Cathedral  (one of  Amer ­ lt:\"a's  most  fabled long  free  climbs),  two  strong  clim bers  fell  to their deaths,  probably  from  the  uprer  ch1m neys  over  1, 000  feet  up  the  wal l.

Having  made  the  fourth  fre e  ascent  of  the  Dtrect  North  But tress ,  and  sever<:  I  for ays  onto  the  route  later  rm,  I  recall  many  places  where  a  leader  1s  fortunat\"'  to  arrangP.  any  protec tion  15  feet,  or  even  20  f�et,  off  the  belay .  And  up  h1gh,  the  be lays  themselv es  invclve  scr atch mg  around  the back.  of  gramy  flares,  lcok1ng  for  anything  remotely  sound .  I  ment1on  this  because  such  scenanos  are  not  uncommon  on  the  upper rungs  of  adv entur e  climb  mg .  Granted,  by  the  time  yCiu  get  ther e  you 'll  have  considerable  expenence  m  bUIIdmg- anchors .

While  ini tially  puzzl ing  and  comple x,  mastering  anchor - building  fundame ntals,  and  the  abil ity  to  fash ion  variations  on  the themes, naturally comes  with  time and  practice.  Most  experienced  climbe rs  can  qu ickly  tell  if  a  given  nut,  cam  or  anchor  is  good or  otherwise,  just  as  a  mason  can  tell  at  a  glance  if  the  bricks  have  been  proper ly  placed  and  mortar ed.  Sta ying  cu rrent  with the  lit erature,  and  taking  an  anchor  seminar ,  can  ra dically  incr ease  your  learning  cur ve  and  pr otection­ placing /anchor -b uilding  competence.  Every  ins tructor  will  have  favored  ways  of  doing  things,  but the  basic,  fiel d-tested  pr inci ples  will  be  the  very  ones  we  have  covered  in this  book .  Can  you  alw ays  quickly  and  sim ply  build  an  anch or?  No.  But  you can  and  should  strive  toward  simplici ty  and  effi cien cy,  avoiding  needless  sling s,  bine rs  and  garish  setups.  In  many  instances,  the  cordel ette-even  with  its  stated  lim itati ons - along  with  the  slidin g X  and  now  the  equale tte,  have  strea mlined  the  busine ss  of  rigging,  especially  where  the  plac em ents  are  spread  ar ound.  And  so  long  as  you  under ­ stand  that  a  sound  Jesus  Nut  pl aced  dir ectly  off  the  belay  is  crucial  to  keep  peak  forces  off  the  belay  anchor  itself,  you are  fa r  along  indeed .  In  closing,  let's  return  to  a  topic  mentioned  in the  introduction:  In  the  con text  of  technical  rock  climbing ,  what  does  secur e  really  mean?  Or  mor e  impor tantly ,  what  should  it  mean?  For  some,  secu rity  is  an  idea  blind  to  the  real life  demands  placed  on  clim ber s  attempting  to  scale  mu ltipitch  adventure  cli mbs.  On  adventure  routes  from  Col- OTH ER  ANCHORS  213  \nFOR  TH E LAST  TIME  ...  Conf ormmg  an  anchor  to  the letter  of  every  sound  pnndple  does  not  guar antee  that  the  anchor will hold  a  single  pound .  The  best  rigging  can  do no  m o re  than exploit  the  potential  holding  !>trength  of  the  prm 1ary  pla cements .  l-Ienee  the  f1rst  rule  in  building  all  anchor s  is  to  get  sound  primary  placemen ts .  With  bomber primar y  place­ ments,  the  rules of thumb  and  modern  rigging  method:;  <;tack  the  odds  in  our  favor  that  the  anchor  will  do  1ts  job and  do  it  well .  orado  to  Chamonix,  time  and  equipm ent  are  variables  that must  be  managed  for  a  climbing  team  to  consis tently  ach ieve  success.  On  big routes,  simpl icity  and  effi­ cienc y- the  Tw in  Pil lars  of  this  text -must  extend  beyond  setti ng  pro  and building  anchors,  to  the  team's  modus oper andi.  In  alpine  setti ngs,  wher e  days  are  shor t  and storms  fr equent,  \"speed  equals  saf ety\"  is  a  common  refra in.  When,  in  the  name  of  sa fety,  a  climbing  team  wastes  time  and limi ted  resources,  at  some  place,  on  some  route,  the team  will  either  have  to  bail  or  rush the  process  up  high  to  compensate  for  time  squander ed  bel ow.  And  sometimes,  the  loss  in  time  was  due  to building  anchor s  that  exceeded  actual  need.  The  st andard  rati onal ization  for  over-bu ilding  belay  anchor s  is  that  an  anchor  is  never  too  strong.  An  extreme  view  on  this  wo uld  consider  ten  bolts  better  than  three.  Here,  appr eciation  for real  world  requir ements  gets  clouded  over  by  phobic  engineering  masquer ading  as  safety.  This view  also  fails  to  recognize  that  the  top  piece  of  pr otection  al ways  sust ain s  the  highe st  loading,  and  that  the  most  critical  job  is  to  rig  things  so  the  topmost  pro,  and  never  the  anchor  itself, catches  any  and  every  fall.  As  for  belay  an chors,  there  is  good  enough,  then  there  is  beyond  good  enough,  the  domain of  the  ideal,  the  per fect,  the  pur ely  theo reti cal.  Canadian  climber  Jeb  Stillman  recently  put  the subject  into  practical  context:  \"M ost  of  us  try  to  construct  anch ors  that  somewhat  exceed  the  standard  of  just  barely  good  enough.  Not  by  tons and  mile s,  but  by  some  acceptable  margin  that  provides  ade quate  peace  of  mind.  Beyo nd  building  an  anchor  that  will  hold,  most  experienced  climb ers  con­ sider  a  couple  possible  what-ifs,  then decide  if  it's  worth  the  tr ouble  of  addr essing  them  versus  their  actu al  lik eli hood  and  consequences.  Every  anchor  I  have  built  has been good  enough.  I'll  admit  that  the margin  has been  tighter  on  a  few,  but  clea rly,  every  single  one  exceeded  the  threshold  of  good  enough.  Those  of  us  who  can't  deter mine  'good  enough'  will  naturally  go  overboard  addin g  features  that  would,  in  theor y,  make  the  anchor  better .  But  at  some  point,  is  it  really?  I  mean,  if  the  question  is  whether  your  anchor  can  hold one  truck  or  three,  one  has  to  ask:  Are you  there  to  climb,  or  suspend  trucks?\"  214  CLIMBING  ANCHORS  \nThat  muc h  said,  ef ficiency  is  the  last  th ing  to  come when  learning  to  buil d  anchors.  In the early stages,  the  focus must  remain  on the  absolute  holding  power  and  the  secu rity  affo rded  by  the  rigging  of  your  anchors,  not  on  how  fast  you  can  build  them  or  how  much  gear  you  can  save  in the  pr ocess.  Be fore  you  truly  know  if your  anchor s  are  good  enough or  not,  it's  wise  to  build  anchor s  strong  enough to suspend  two  trucks,  instead  of  one.  Later  if  your ambi­ tion  dr ives  you  up  the  rungs  of  adventure  climbing ,  you  will  by  that  time  have  refi ned  yo ur  technique  to  the  point  that  you  can  settle  for  one  truck  anchor  str eng th,  which  you  can  fashion simply  and  ef ficie ntly.  And  you  wi ll  have  to  if  you're  ever  to  savor  the  spoils  of  adventure  climbin g.  At  some  time in your  climbing  career ,  be it  one  or  twenty years  into  it,  you'll  seriously  qu estion  why you are  climbing  at  all.  This  is  not hing  less  than  squaring  off  with  the  Main  Question  of  why are we  ali ve,  what  are  we  doing ,  wher e  are  we  going?  The  Main  Question  sneak s  into the co ntext  of  climbing  because,  well,  beca use  we' re  cli mbers.  And  every  climber  is  on  a  voyage  of  disc ove ry,  no  matter  how  uns tated  or  unconscious  the  voyage  mig ht  be. We  can  answer  the  Main  Ques­ tion  with  fancy  opinions  and  second-hand  bel iefs.  We  mi ght  even  thr ow  the  ques­ tion  back  on  itself, which  is  like  telling  God  to  ask  somebody  else.  I  reckon  any  meani ngful  response  fo ll ows  the  requirements  of  building  a  solid  anc hor .  In  fact,  your  answer  to  the  Main  Question  is  your  anchor  in  life,  and  in that  sense  your  pr i­ mary  placem ents  must  be  bom bproof  and  the  rigging  sim ply  and  effi ciently  arr ang ed .  The  noted  chef  Wolfgang  Puck  pr ofessed  his  own  anchor  matrix  in  a  sim­ ple  but  te lling  motto:  Live,  Love,  Eat.  For  many  of  us,  it's  Live,  Love,  and  Climb.  Per­ haps  the  Main  Question  bubbles  up  when  we  te mpor arily  misplace  the  first  two  place ments  in  the  matrix,  or  when  we're  belaying  off  only  the  th ir d,  instead  of  being  equali zed  between  all  three.  Everyo ne  must  answer  the  Main Que stion  in  their  own  way,  but  one  thing  remains  the same  for  us all:  To  see  this  great  voyage  of  disc overy  all  the  way  through,  we've  got  nothing  if  we  don't  ha ve  solid  anc hors.  We  come  to  the  cl iffs ide  to climb,  and  we  build  goad-enough  anc hors  and  immedia tely  slot  that  Jesus  Nut,  in  order  to  safeguard  our  lives.  Without  a  secur e  safety  system,  climbing  is  absurd.  And  without  effi cien cy,  climbin g  becomes  a  ploddi ng,  fear-based  sham.  Let  us  ne ver  forget  that the  safety  system was  devised  to  fa cil itate  climbi ng.  That's  the  name  of  the  game.  Climb  safe ly.  Climb  ef ficien tly.  Climb  on.
